  {"id":"ajzen1991","abstract":"Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ajzen","given":"Icek"}],"citation-key":"ajzen1991","collection-title":"Theories of Cognitive Self-Regulation","container-title":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","container-title-short":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","DOI":"10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T","ISSN":"0749-5978","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"179-211","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The theory of planned behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074959789190020T","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"allen2017","abstract":"Defined as sexually explicit material that elicits erotic thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, internet pornography is a prevalent form of media that may facilitate problematic use and craving for engagement. Research suggests that superordinate cognitions and information processing, such as desire thinking and metacognition, are central to the activation and escalation of craving in addictive behaviours. The current study aimed to contribute to the literature by testing the proposed metacognitive model of desire thinking and craving in a sample of problematic pornography users, while revising the model by incorporating negative affect. From a theoretical perspective, environmental cues trigger positive metacognitions about desire thinking that directly influence desire thinking, resulting in the escalation of craving, negative metacognitions, and negative affect. Participants were recruited via an online survey and screened for problematic internet pornography use. Path analyses were used to investigate relationships among the aforementioned constructs in a final sample of 191 participants. Consistent with previous research, results of this study validated the existence of metacognitive processes in the activation of desire thinking and escalation of craving, while indicating that desire thinking has the potential to influence negative affect. Additionally, results supported the role of significant indirect relationships between constructs within the revised model of metacognition, desire thinking, and psychopathology. Collectively, the findings demonstrate the clinical value of a metacognitive conceptualisation of problematic pornography use. Exploring the metacognitive mechanisms that underpin problematic internet pornography use may give rise to the development of new treatment and relapse prevention strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kannis-Dymand","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Katsikitis","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"allen2017","container-title":"Addictive Behaviors","container-title-short":"Addictive Behaviors","DOI":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.02.001","ISSN":"0306-4603","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"65-71","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Problematic internet pornography use: the role of craving, desire thinking, and metacognition","title-short":"Problematic internet pornography use","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460317300655","volume":"70"},

  {"id":"amit2012","abstract":"We conducted three experiments indicating that characteristically deontological judgments—here, disapproving of sacrificing one person for the greater good of others—are preferentially supported by visual imagery. Experiment 1 used two matched working memory tasks—one visual, one verbal—to identify individuals with relatively visual cognitive styles and individuals with relatively verbal cognitive styles. Individuals with more visual cognitive styles made more deontological judgments. Experiment 2 showed that visual interference, relative to verbal interference and no interference, decreases deontological judgment. Experiment 3 indicated that these effects are due to people’s tendency to visualize the harmful means (sacrificing one person) more than the beneficial end (saving others). These results suggest a specific role for visual imagery in moral judgment: When people consider sacrificing someone as a means to an end, visual imagery preferentially supports the judgment that the ends do not justify the means. These results suggest an integration of the dual-process theory of moral judgment with construal-level theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Amit","given":"Elinor"},{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."}],"citation-key":"amit2012","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797611434965","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8]]},"language":"en","page":"861-868","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"You see, the ends don’t justify the means: visual imagery and moral judgment","title-short":"You see, the ends don’t justify the means","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611434965","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"andersen1994","abstract":"Sexual self-schemas are cognitive generalizations about sexual aspects of oneself. In Part 1, a measure of men's sexual self-schema is developed. Studies of test—retest and internal consistency reliability and validity studies of factor analysis, internal structure, convergent and discriminant validity, process, group difference, and change are provided. The construct consists of 3 dimensions: passionate—loving, powerful-aggressive, and open-minded-liberal traits. In Part 2, the data suggest that men's sexual schema is derived from past sexual experience, is manifest in current sexual experience, and guides future sexual behavior. In Part 3, the data document the cognitive processing aspects of sexual schema. Consistent with the investigators' schema research with women, these data substantiate the importance of cognitive representations of sexuality. Historically, research on male sexuality has focused on the assessment of men's sexual behaviors, sexual responses, and related sexual affects or attitudes. In contrast, little research has explored men's sexuality as a social-cognitive phenomenon or attempted to map men's cognitive views of the sexual self. Andersen and Cyranowski (1994) offered the concept of sexual self-schema as an aspect of one's self-view that is specific to sexuality and operationalized this construct with respect to women's sexuality. Conceptually, men should also possess sexual selfschemas; however, the content of men's sexual self-views was expected to differ from that obtained with women. Here we outline the conceptual framework for men's sexual self-schema and detail the psychometric properties of a scale to measure a man's sexual self-schema. First, however, we offer a brief overview of the common approaches to male sexual assessment. Second, we outline the conceptual and methodological advantages of the sexual self-schema approach, and third, we highlight the literature related to the gender differences that were expected to emerge in the content of men's (vs. women's) sexual self-views.","author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Barbara L."},{"family":"Cyranowski","given":"Jill M."},{"family":"Espindle","given":"Derek"}],"citation-key":"andersen1994","DOI":"10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1079","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Women's sexual self-schema.","type":"paper-conference"},

Questionnaires administered to 112 undergraduate women revealed a significant relationship between the acceptance of traditional feminine social roles and a belief in rape myths (e.g., \"only bad girls get raped\"). The size of the correlation indicated that some women with traditional attitudes also believe that women should be independent and have equal rights. Results suggest that some Ss held the belief that it is natural for women to be submissive to men but rejected the belief that women are in part responsible by their actions for being raped. Women with traditional definitions were more likely to disbelieve another woman's report that she had been raped.

Major domain-limited theories of aggression include cognitive neoassociation, social learning, social interaction, script, and excitation transfer theories. Using the general aggression model (GAM), this review posits cognition, affect, and arousal to mediate the effects of situational and personological variables on aggression. The review also organizes recent theories of the development and persistence of aggressive personality. Personality is conceptualized as a set of stable knowledge structures that individuals use to interpret events in their social world and to guide their behavior. In addition to organizing what is already known about human aggression, this review, using the GAM framework, also serves the heuristic function of suggesting what research is needed to fill in theoretical gaps and can be used to create and test interventions for reducing aggression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Bushman","given":"Brad J."}],"citation-key":"anderson2002","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"27-51","PMID":"11752478","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Human aggression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231","volume":"53"},

However, little is known about the personal sense of power because very few studies have examined it empirically. In studies involving a total of 1,141 participants and nine different samples, we found that the personal sense of power was coherent within social contexts; for example, individuals who believed that they can get their way in a group also believed that they can influence fellow group members’ attitudes and opinions. The personal sense of power was also moderately consistent across relationships but showed considerable relationship specificity; for example, individuals’ personal sense of power vis-à-vis their friend tended to be distinct but moderately related to their personal sense of power vis-à-vis their parent. And the personal sense of power was affected not only by sociostructural factors (e.g., social position, status) but also by personality variables such as dominance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"John","given":"Oliver P."},{"family":"Keltner","given":"Dacher"}],"citation-key":"anderson2012","container-title":"Journal of Personality","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00734.x","ISSN":"1467-6494","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"313-344","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The personal sense of power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00734.x","volume":"80"},

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the role of husband/partner controlling behavior in the risk of ever experiencing physical and sexual violence among 2877 women aged 15 - 49 years who were currently or formerly married or cohabiting with a male partner.\nResults: Women who reported controlling behavior by husband/partner had a higher likelihood of experiencing physical violence (RR = 3.04; 95% CI: 2.50 - 3.69), and women resident in rural areas and working in low status occupations had increased likelihood of experiencing physical IPV. Controlling behavior by husband/partner was associated with higher likelihood of experiencing physical violence (RR = 4.01; 95% CI: 2.54 - 6.34). In addition, women who justified wife beating and earned more than their husband/partner were at higher likelihood of experiencing physical and sexual violence. In contrast, women who had decision-making autonomy had lower likelihood of experiencing physical and sexual violence.\nConclusion: Controlling behavior by husband/partner significantly increases the likelihood of physical and sexual IPV, thus acting as a precursor to violence. Findings emphasize the need to adopt a proactive integrated approach to controlling behavior and intimate partner violence within the society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Antai","given":"Diddy"}],"citation-key":"antai2011","container-title":"BMC Public Health","container-title-short":"BMC Public Health","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2458-11-511","ISSN":"1471-2458","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"language":"en","page":"511","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Controlling behavior, power relations within intimate relationships and intimate partner physical and sexual violence against women in nigeria","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-511","volume":"11"},

Recent research shows that some individuals have a strong desire to incite chaos when they perceive themselves to be marginalized by society. These individuals tend to see chaos as a way to invert the power structure and gain social status in the process. Analysing data drawn from large-scale representative surveys conducted in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, we identify the prevalence of Need for Chaos across Anglo-Saxon societies. Using Latent Profile Analysis, we explore whether different subtypes underlie the uni-dimensional construct and find evidence that some people may be motivated to seek out chaos because they want to rebuild society, while others enjoy destruction for its own sake. We demonstrate that chaos-seekers are not a unified political group but a divergent set of malcontents.

Women were slightly more likely (d = –.05) than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to use such acts more frequently. Men were more likely (d = .15) to inflict an injury, and overall, 62% of those injured by a partner were women. The findings partially support previous claims that different methods of measurement produce conflicting results, but there was also evidence that the sample was an important moderator of effect size. Continuous models showed that younger aged dating samples and a lower proportion of physically aggressive males predicted effect sizes in the female direction. Analyses were limited by the available database, which is biased toward young dating samples in the United States.

  {"id":"atkinson2021","abstract":"Though there is substantial evidence that individuals can prioritize more valuable information in visual working memory (WM), little research has examined this in the verbal domain. Four experiments were conducted to investigate this and the conditions under which effects emerge. In each experiment, participants listened to digit sequences and then attempted to recall them in the correct order. At the start of each block, participants were either told that all items were of equal value, or that an item at a particular serial position was worth more points. Recall was enhanced for these higher value items (Experiment 1a), a finding that was replicated while rejecting an alternative account based on distinctiveness (Experiment 1b). Thus, valuable information can be prioritized in verbal WM. Two further experiments investigated whether these boosts remained when participants completed a simple concurrent task disrupting verbal rehearsal (Experiment 2), or a complex concurrent task disrupting verbal rehearsal and executive resources (Experiment 3). Under simple concurrent task conditions, prioritization boosts were observed, but with increased costs to the less valuable items. Prioritization effects were also observed under complex concurrent task conditions, although this was accompanied by chance-level performance at most of the less valuable positions. A substantial recency advantage was also observed for the final item in each sequence, across all conditions. Taken together, this indicates that individuals can prioritize valuable information in verbal WM even when rehearsal and executive resources are disrupted, though they do so by neglecting or abandoning other items in the sequence.

Inducing threat to men’s dominance over women by assigning men to work under the supervision of women bosses—versus jointly with women partners (Study 2a) or under men bosses (Study 3)—led to increased sexual objectification of women among high-SDO participants. These results persisted when controlling for mood. Examining the corresponding effects among heterosexual women revealed that the correlation between SDO and the sexual objectification of men was non-significant (Study 1) and that working under men bosses did not affect women’s sexual objectification of men (Study 2b). These findings support feminist theorizing that men (re)assert their dominance over women by sexually objectifying them.

  {"id":"barkow1975","abstract":"Examination of human prestige-striving in phylogenetic perspective suggests it to be essentially homologous with primate social dominance. In our own species, however, selection for \"cultural capacity\" has transformed striving for social dominance into striving to evaluate the self as being higher in rank than others or, in other words, into striving for self-esteem. We maintain self-esteem through symbolic means, usually referred to as seeking \"prestige.\" We also utilize various distortions of perception and cognition to this end, including rationalization, identification, and change of reference group. Prestige strategies may emphasize attaining prestige through being part of a prestigious group or may be more individualistically oriented. They may also stress receipt of the approbation of internal representations of absent or imaginary others or emphasize the respect of those physically present. Traditional societies provide culturally patterned strategies which tend to perpetuate these societies. Thus, success in the hunt brings prestige among hunting peoples, large herds among pastoralists, etc. Culturally constituted rationalizations help to maintain the self-esteem of those who fail. Culture contact is one of the chief causes of the failure of prestige-allocation systems, the very existence of wealthy and powerful newcomers devaluing the coin of the prestige obtainable through traditional strategies. Newly development prestige strategies are likely to have deleterious long-term effects on social stability. The so-called need for achievement reveals itself to be a particular type of prestige strategy, one emphasizing entrepreneurial tactics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Barkow","given":"Jerome H."},{"family":"Akiwowo","given":"Akinsola A."},{"family":"Barua","given":"Tushar K."},{"family":"Chance","given":"M.

In this two-component model, the cognitive component involves perspective taking, and the affective component involves experiencing appropriate emotion. In this review, we identify how this assumption has both dominated and limited empathy research with offenders, nearly all of which has been conducted with sexual offenders. We propose instead that five components are involved in the experience of empathy: perspective taking, the ability to experience emotion, a belief that others are worthy of compassion and respect, situational factors, and an ability to manage personal distress. We suggest that the non-situational factors that blocked empathy for the victim at the time of a sexual offense are probably other dispositions known to be related to sexual offending, such as sexual preoccupation, generalized hostility to others, implicit theories about children and sex, and/or poor coping with negative emotions. We conclude with directions for practice and research, and urge greater caution in correctional policies on victim empathy programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnett","given":"Georgia D."},{"family":"Mann","given":"Ruth E."}],"citation-key":"barnett2013","container-title":"Trauma, Violence, & Abuse","container-title-short":"Trauma, Violence, & Abuse","DOI":"10.1177/1524838012467857","ISSN":"1524-8380","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"22-33","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Cognition, empathy, and sexual offending","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838012467857","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"barron2020","abstract":"Human same-sex sexual attraction (SSSA) has long been considered to be an evolutionary puzzle. The trait is clearly biological: it is widespread and has a strong additive genetic basis, but how SSSA has evolved remains a subject of debate. Of itself, homosexual sexual behaviour will not yield offspring, and consequently individuals expressing strong SSSA that are mostly or exclusively homosexual are presumed to have lower fitness and reproductive success. How then did the trait evolve, and how is it maintained in populations? Here we develop a novel argument for the evolution of SSSA that focuses on the likely adaptive social consequences of SSSA. We argue that same sex sexual attraction evolved as just one of a suite of traits responding to strong selection for ease of social integration or prosocial behaviour. A strong driver of recent human behavioural evolution has been selection for reduced reactive aggression, increased social affiliation, social communication and ease of social integration. In many prosocial mammals sex has adopted new social functions in contexts of social bonding, social reinforcement, appeasement and play. We argue that for humans the social functions and benefits of sex apply to same-sex sexual behaviour as well as heterosexual behaviour.

  {"id":"bastian2013","abstract":"People not only dehumanize others, they also dehumanize the self in response to their own harmful behavior. We examine this self-dehumanization effect across four studies. Studies 1 and 2 show that when participants are perpetrators of social ostracism, they view themselves as less human compared with when they engage in nonaversive interpersonal interactions. Perceived immorality of their behavior mediated this effect. Studies 3 and 4 highlight the behavioral consequences of self-dehumanization. The extent to which participants saw themselves as less human after perpetrating social ostracism predicted subsequent prosocial behavior. Studies 2 to 4 also demonstrate that consequences of self-dehumanization occur independently of any effects of self-esteem or mood. The findings are discussed in relation to previous work on dehumanization and self-perception. We conclude that in the context of immoral actions (self) dehumanization may be functional.","author":[{"family":"Bastian","given":"Brock"},{"family":"Jetten","given":"Jolanda"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Radke","given":"Helena R.

  {"id":"basu2010","abstract":"Much of economics is built on the assumption that individuals are driven by self-interest and economic development is an outcome of the free play of such individuals. On the few occasions that the existence of altruism is recognized in economics, the tendency is to build this from the axiom of individual selfishness. The aim of this paper is to break from this tradition and to treat as a primitive that individuals are endowed with the 'cooperative spirit', which allows them to work in their collective interest, even when that may not be in their self-interest. The paper tracks the interface between altruism and group identity. By using the basic structure of a Prisoner's Dilemma game among randomly picked individuals and building into it assumptions of general or in-group altruism, the paper demonstrates how our selfish rationality interacts with our innate sense of cooperation.

In this paper, we study how the formation of other-regarding preferences during childhood is related to parental background. Our subjects, aged 4–12 years, are classified into other-regarding types based on simple binary-choice dictator games. The main finding is that the children of parents with low education are less altruistic, more selfish, and more likely to be weakly spiteful. This link is robust to controlling for a rich set of children’s characteristics and class fixed effects. It also stands out against the overall development of preferences, as we find children to become more altruistic, less selfish, and less likely to be weakly spiteful with increasing age. The results, supported by a complementary analysis of World Values Survey data, suggest an important role of socialization in the formation of other-regarding preferences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Chytilová","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Pertold-Gebicka","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"bauer2014","container-title":"Experimental Economics","container-title-short":"Exp Econ","DOI":"10.1007/s10683-013-9355-y","ISSN":"1573-6938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"24-46","source":"Springer Link","title":"Parental background and other-regarding preferences in children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10683-013-9355-y","volume":"17"},

We are concerned that studies of sacrificial dilemmas may lack experimental, mundane, and psychological realism and therefore suffer from low external validity. Our apprehensions stem from three observations about trolley problems and other similar sacrificial dilemmas: (i) they are amusing rather than sobering, (ii) they are unrealistic and unrepresentative of the moral situations people encounter in the real world, and (iii) they do not elicit the same psychological processes as other moral situations.

Religious and philosophical traditions in India stress its role in emancipating the ego and providing an understanding for one’s perspective as contrasted against the magnanimity of the Almighty, the Supernatural or the Universe. Most academicians within the scientific psychological realm also look upon humility as a virtue. Accredited as a powerful tool for personal, social and organisational well-being, humility, as a moral construct, deserves a thorough and detailed exploration to reveal what it entails, what its corollaries are and how it can be measured. It is particularly useful in Indian context, as indigenous traditions have always emphasised humility. However, such efforts have remained relatively neglected till recent years. Of course, a few researchers with emphasis on moral and positive psychology have probed and prodded this concept to lay bare its comprising elements and to build tools to measure it. These attempts have been discussed here. Information was culled from surveying the scientific literature of the past four decades from psychological and philosophical journals and handbooks. Its overlap with Indian concept of humility has been discussed, and the unresolved questions about its nuances are put forward for future research endeavour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"Oindrila"},{"family":"Chatterjee","given":"Amita"},{"family":"Basu","given":"Jayanti"}],"citation-key":"bhattacharya2017","container-title":"Psychological Studies","container-title-short":"Psychol Stud","DOI":"10.1007/s12646-017-0387-9","ISSN":"0974-9861","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"Springer Link","title":"Humility: an emerging construct in moral psychology","title-short":"Humility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12646-017-0387-9","volume":"62"},

Blair (1993) has suggested that humans possess a functionally similar mechanism which mediates the suppression of aggression in the context of distress cues. He has suggested that this mechanism is a prerequisite for the development of the moral/conventional distinction; the consistently observed distinction in subject's judgments between moral and conventional transgressions. Psychopaths may lack this violence inhibitor. A causal model is developed showing how the lack of this mechanism would explain the core behavioural symptoms associated with the psychopathic disorder. A prediction of such a causal model would be that psychopaths should fail to make the moral/conventional distinction. This prediction was confirmed.

They also wrote essays justifying their ratings. Overall and in support of previous research, older adults were more likely than younger adults to attribute the cause of the negative outcome to the primary character (Blanchard-Fields, 1994). This bias was not attenuated by the age-relevance factor. Instead, in the work context, older and middle-aged adults placed greater blame on main characters relevant to their age group for negative outcomes than did young adults. However, older adults were also more likely than middle-aged or young adults to attribute the cause of a negative outcome to situational factors. Age relevance and context influenced attributional ratings for all participants in that: (a) older characters were rated higher on external attributions and younger characters were rated higher on internal attributions; and (b) higher internal attributions were made for work situations than for family situations. Finally, young and middle-aged adults were more dialectical in justifying their causal attributions than older adults.

However, little conceptual thinking has been done about the relations between moral cognition and moral action. As a result, empirical research in this area has been unsystematic and difficult to interpret. A theoretical model, the Self Model, is proposed here, starting from the assumption that moral reasons are functionally related to action. First, a concept of cognitive motivation is presented as necessary for any cognitive account of morality. Two cognitive approaches to moral conduct, Piaget's and Haan's, are then discussed in their positive contributions and in their limitations. The Self Model is finally described through a set of empirically testable propositions. Its major theoretical characteristics are: it is cognitive, recognizing as the central function of human cognition the appraisal of truth; it acknowledges a basic duality of motivation, but stresses the normative pull of cognitive motivation; it is developmental; it uses the self as the central explanatory concept, establishing both the sense of personal responsibility and the dynamism of self-consistency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Blasi","given":"Augusto"}],"citation-key":"blasi1983","container-title":"Developmental Review","container-title-short":"Developmental Review","DOI":"10.1016/0273-2297(83)90029-1","ISSN":"0273-2297","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"178-210","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Moral cognition and moral action: A theoretical perspective","title-short":"Moral cognition and moral action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0273229783900291","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"boyer2018","abstract":"The domain of “folk-economics” consists in explicit beliefs about the economy held by laypeople, untrained in economics, about such topics as, for example, the causes of the wealth of nations, the benefits or drawbacks of markets and international trade, the effects of regulation, the origins of inequality, the connection between work and wages, the economic consequences of immigration, or the possible causes of unemployment. These beliefs are crucial in forming people's political beliefs and in shaping their reception of different policies. Yet, they often conflict with elementary principles of economic theory and are often described as the consequences of ignorance, irrationality, or specific biases. As we will argue, these past perspectives fail to predict the particular contents of popular folk-economic beliefs and, as a result, there is no systematic study of the cognitive factors involved in their emergence and cultural success. Here we propose that the cultural success of particular beliefs about the economy is predictable if we consider the influence of specialized, largely automatic inference systems that evolved as adaptations to ancestral human small-scale sociality. These systems, for which there is independent evidence, include free-rider detection, fairness-based partner choice, ownership intuitions, coalitional psychology, and more. Information about modern mass-market conditions activates these specific inference systems, resulting in particular intuitions, for example, that impersonal transactions are dangerous or that international trade is a zero-sum game. These intuitions in turn make specific policy proposals more likely than others to become intuitively compelling, and, as a consequence, exert a crucial influence on political choices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyer","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"}],"citation-key":"boyer2018","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X17001960","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","issued":{"literal":"2018/ed"},"language":"en","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Folk-economic beliefs: an evolutionary cognitive model","title-short":"Folk-economic beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/folkeconomic-beliefs-an-evolutionary-cognitive-model/7D84E452710ACCC6A35D49B8590B614F","volume":"41"},

We demonstrate gender differences in moral judgments: males are more supportive of the sacrifice than females. We investigate a source of the endorsement of the sacrifice: antisocial preferences. First, we measure individual proneness to spiteful behavior, using an experimental game with monetary stakes. We demonstrate that spitefulness can be sizable—a fifth of our participants behave spitefully—but it is not associated with gender. Second, we find that gender is consistently associated with responses even when we account for individual differences in the propensity to spitefulness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bracht","given":"Juergen"},{"family":"Zylbersztejn","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"bracht2018","container-title":"Theory and Decision","container-title-short":"Theory Decis","DOI":"10.1007/s11238-018-9668-6","ISSN":"1573-7187","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"389-406","source":"Springer Link","title":"Moral judgments, gender, and antisocial preferences: an experimental study","title-short":"Moral judgments, gender, and antisocial preferences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11238-018-9668-6","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"braun2017","abstract":"Narcissists often pursue leadership and are selected for leadership positions by others. At the same time, they act in their own best interest, putting the needs and interests of others at risk. While theoretical arguments clearly link narcissism and leadership, the question whether leader narcissism is good or bad for organizations and their members remains unanswered. Narcissism seems to have two sides, a bright and a dark one. This systematic literature review seeks to contribute to the ongoing academic discussion about the positive or negative impact of leader narcissism in organizations. Forty-five original research articles were categorized according to outcomes at three levels of analysis: the dyadic level (focusing on leader-follower relationships), the team level (focusing on work teams and small groups), and the organizational level. On this basis, we first summarized the current state of knowledge about the impact that leader narcissism has on outcomes at different levels of analysis. Next, we revealed similarities and contradictions between research findings within and across levels of analysis, highlighting persistent inconsistencies concerning the question whether leader narcissism has positive or negative consequences. Finally, we outlined theoretical and methodological implications for future studies of leader narcissism. This multi-level perspective ascertains a new, systematic view of leader narcissism and its consequences for organizations and their stakeholders. The article demonstrates the need for future research in the field of leader narcissism and opens up new avenues for inquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Braun","given":"Susanne"}],"citation-key":"braun2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10/f98psd","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"773","source":"Frontiers","title":"Leader narcissism and outcomes in organizations: A review at multiple levels of analysis and implications for future research","title-short":"Leader narcissism and outcomes in organizations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00773","volume":"8"},

In a 2 x 3 study that varied the gruesome content of photographic and verbal evidence, gruesome verbal evidence did not influence mock juror emotional states, and had no impact on the conviction rate. Mock jurors who saw gruesome photographs, compared with those who saw no photographs, reported experiencing significantly more intense emotional responses, including greater anger at the defendant. The conviction rate when visual evidence in the form of gruesome or neutral photographs was included was significantly higher than the conviction rate without photographic evidence. Mean ratings of the inculpatory weight of prosecution evidence by mock jurors presented with gruesome photographs were significantly higher than those by mock jurors who did not view any photographs. Further analyses revealed that mock juror anger toward the defendant mediated the influence of the gruesome photographs in enhancing the weight of inculpatory evidence.","author":[{"family":"Bright","given":"David A."},{"family":"Goodman-Delahunty","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"bright2006","container-title":"Law and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Law Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s10979-006-9027-y","ISSN":"0147-7307","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"183-202","PMID":"16786406","source":"PubMed","title":"Gruesome evidence and emotion: anger, blame, and jury decision-making","title-short":"Gruesome evidence and emotion","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

The present study sought to examine the role of grandiose narcissism, as well as narcissistic traits (entitlement, exploitativeness, grandiosity), in the prediction of involvement in risk-taking behaviors. Participants were 630 undergraduates, split into two subgroups, who completed measures assessing likelihood of and actual involvement in risk-taking behaviors, perceived risks and benefits of the behaviors, delay discounting, grandiose narcissism, and narcissistic traits. Greater levels of grandiose narcissism predicted reported likelihood of risk-taking and risk-taking behaviors in the past 30 days. This relationship appears driven by grandiosity and exploitativeness rather than entitlement. Grandiose narcissism and entitlement were independently associated with a preference for smaller, more immediate gains over larger, temporally distant rewards.

We investigate the relationship between children’s cognitive skills and spiteful behavior in a sample of 214 preschoolers aged 5–6 and their mothers. Here, other-regarding behavior in children is elicited through four simple allocation decisions. A key advantage of our study is that we have information about children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills as well as maternal and household characteristics. We find that higher cognitive skills are associated with more spiteful behavior in children. This relationship is even more pronounced among boys.

Emerging experimental approaches such as cognitive simulation and simulated social interaction offer opportunities to investigate ToM in interactive, “first-person” and “second-person” scenarios while affording greater experimental control. The advantages and limitations of traditional and emerging ToM methodologies are discussed with the intent of advancing the understanding of ToM in socially mediated situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Byom","given":"Lindsey J."},{"family":"Mutlu","given":"Bilge"}],"citation-key":"byom2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front Hum Neurosci","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2013.00413","ISSN":"1662-5161","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,8]]},"PMCID":"PMC3737477","PMID":"23964218","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Theory of mind: mechanisms, methods, and new directions","title-short":"Theory of mind","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737477/","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"byrne1976","abstract":"Past research on sexual behavior may be viewed as a progressive evolution from less taboo concerns (animal behavior, studies of primitive cultures, and abnormality) to the succession of \"shocks\" that attended the extension of sexual knowledge to the normal, contemporary human sphere with Freud, Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson. Social psychologists were attracted to this area by the revolutionary societal changes in attitudinal permissiveness and in actual behavior, by the research initiated by the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, and by a pressing applied interest in solving the problems of unwanted and unneeded conception. Sex research is of special value to our field because it has built-in experimental impact, its technology includes the direct nonverbal assessment of a motivational-emotional state, and it is of obvious relevance to innumerable real- life issues. Upon examination, many of the traditional principles and research paradigms of social-personality psychologists may be perceived as being directly relevant to an understanding of sexuality. A tentative model of a social psychological approach to this research domain (the Sexual Behavior Sequence) is presented. Finally, the interdisciplinary and international aspects of sex research are noted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Byrne","given":"Donn"}],"citation-key":"byrne1976","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1177/014616727600300102","ISSN":"0146-1672","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1976,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-30","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Social psychology and the study of sexual behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/014616727600300102","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"cabondhersin2007","abstract":"This paper interests itself in a \"game of chicken\" involving heterogeneous players. More precisely, it examines the conditions for the initiation and engagement of cooperative agreements between two types of economic agents: (i) those with a standard rationality (maximization of own payoffs); and (ii) those with a preference for cooperative behaviour (after contract initiation). Each agent knows his own \"type\" but is ignorant of the \"type\" of his partner in the game. However the proportion of the two types of players in the population is common knowledge. This analysis concerns a non-repeated game under incomplete information without the possibility of eliminating opportunism through contracts. We show that higher the proportion of \"rational\" individuals in the population, higher the incentives for these players to cooperate. A minimum of \"rational' agents is necessary to induce cooperation from this population group. The degree of cooperation in the entire population is however independent of the initial proportion of \"rational\" agents being dictated by the payoff configurations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cabon-Dhersin","given":"Marie-Laure"},{"family":"Ramani","given":"Shyama V."}],"citation-key":"cabondhersin2007","container-title":"Revue d'Économie Politique; Paris","ISSN":"03732630","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"Mar/Apr 2007"},"language":"French","page":"271-284","source":"ProQuest","title":"La rationalité des agents économiques va-t-elle toujours à l'encontre de la coopération ?

Two hundred and fourteen university students (83 men and 131 women), mean age 20.39 years old, participated. The results show that there is a high correlation between RMA and hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, culture of honour, and right-wing authoritarianism. Hostile sexism and right-wing authoritarianism predict RMA in both male and female samples. Benevolent sexism predicts RMA in the female sample. In addition, in the male sample right-wing authoritarianism interacts with hostile sexism to predict RMA, while in the female sample right-wing authoritarianism interacts with benevolent sexism to predict RMA.

In one treatment, subjects were assigned to the role of proposer or responder and played a trust game with random matching for 20 rounds. In a second treatment, the modified game, the procedures were the same, but responders were allowed to choose with only 80% probability. With 20% probability, responders were restricted to keep any money passed. Only responders knew whether they were restricted or not. We find that the behavior of responders is different in this modified trust game. The fact that responders can hide selfish acts generates more selfish behavior. This in turn makes proposers less likely to pass money to responders, thereby destroying trust. We find important session effects in the standard trust game but less so in the modified game.

  {"id":"caviola2021","abstract":"Most people hold that it is wrong to sacrifice some humans to save a greater number of humans. Do people also think that it is wrong to sacrifice some animals to save a greater number of animals, or do they answer such questions about harm to animals by engaging in a utilitarian cost-benefit calculation? Across 10 studies (N = 4,662), using hypothetical and real-life sacrificial moral dilemmas, we found that participants considered it more permissible to harm a few animals to save a greater number of animals than to harm a few humans to save a greater number of humans. This was explained by a reduced general aversion to harm animals compared with humans, which was partly driven by participants perceiving animals to suffer less and to have lower cognitive capacity than humans. However, the effect persisted even in cases where animals were described as having greater suffering capacity and greater cognitive capacity than some humans, and even when participants felt more socially connected to animals than to humans. The reduced aversion to harming animals was thus also partly due to speciesism—the tendency to ascribe lower moral value to animals due to their species-membership alone. In sum, our studies show that deontological constraints against instrumental harm are not absolute but get weaker the less people morally value the respective entity. These constraints are strongest for humans, followed by dogs, chimpanzees, pigs, and finally inanimate objects.

  {"id":"chen2021","abstract":"To extend decision theory models to account for observed choice behavior in sequential risky choices with multiple outcomes, the present study examined and compared 30 heuristic choice models and 6 baseline choice models in a naturalistic, sequential high-stakes game show context. One-thousand and ninety-five games from one British and two American versions of the Deal or No Deal (DOND) game were included in the analysis. The heuristic choice models were constructed by pairing 10 different decision heuristic assumptions with 3 fundamental choice models, including a ratio, an expected utility, and a probability discounting model. The baseline models directly employed the three fundamental choice models with two different sets of outcomes. A nonparametric ratio model, with the decision heuristic assumptions of a reference-dependent probability of winning and a representative value of a sum of all outcomes in a risky choice, significantly outperformed the other 35 descriptive choice models in accounting for observed sequential choices. The reference-dependent probability proposed in the present study represents the overall probability of winning or losing, given a reference outcome in a complex risky choice. A representative value, rather than each single outcome, was added to the choice model. The total percentage of players whose binary choices are consistent with our best model is 94.25%. Compared to the other models, the most consistent model showed more distinct correct predictions. The overall results suggest that players in the DOND game make sequential risky choices with multiple outcomes in a heuristic manner.

The traditional, ‘unitary’ model of the family, which assumes that members maximize a single utility function, has increasingly been challenged in recent decades, as a consequence of a questioning of the underlying income-pooling hypothesis, through attempts to assume differential preferences of family members, with the relative power of spouses being of particular significance. These non-unitary models treat family decisions as outcomes of interactions between the spouses. We focus here on collective models, which have been most widely used for that purpose. We show international evidence on the basis of the UN Human Development Index 2018. Data results indicate that, in both developed (very high and top medium HDI) and non-developed (bottom medium and low HDI) cultural areas, non-unitary models, in which intra-spousal bargaining power plays a role, are empirically accepted. The Pareto-optimality hypothesis of collective models has been accepted for most statistical data bases. In developed cultural areas, wives, on average, control between one half and two thirds of household resources, with the highest bargaining power affecting expenditure patterns. As the bargaining power of women grows, allocations to education and school attendance also tend to grow in most countries.","author":[{"family":"Chiappori","given":"Pierre-André"},{"family":"Molina","given":"José Alberto"}],"citation-key":"chiappori2019","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"1 the intra-spousal balance of power within the family : cross-cultural evidence","title-short":"1 the intra-spousal balance of power within the family","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"clifford2015","abstract":"Research on the emotional, cognitive, and social determinants of moral judgment has surged in recent years. The development of moral foundations theory (MFT) has played an important role, demonstrating the breadth of morality. Moral psychology has responded by investigating how different domains of moral judgment are shaped by a variety of psychological factors. Yet, the discipline lacks a validated set of moral violations that span the moral domain, creating a barrier to investigating influences on judgment and how their neural bases might vary across the moral domain. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by developing and validating a large set of moral foundations vignettes (MFVs). Each vignette depicts a behavior violating a particular moral foundation and not others.

We demonstrate the validity of our vignettes by examining respondents’ classifications of moral violations, conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and demonstrating the correspondence between the extracted factors and existing measures of the moral foundations.

In social animals, retaliatory aggression is common, individuals often punish other group members that infringe their interests, and punishment can cause subordinates to desist from behaviour likely to reduce the fitness of dominant animals. Punishing strategies are used to establish and maintain dominance relationships, to discourage parasites and cheats, to discipline offspring or prospective sexual partners and to maintain cooperative behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Clutton-Brock","given":"T.

In the current study, 329 participants in committed romantic relationships completed measures of their dominance orientation, prestige orientation, and mate retention behavior. It was predicted that dominance-oriented partners would engage in tactics designed to force or coerce relationship commitment, whereas prestige-oriented partners (primarily men) would engage in tactics such as resource display and avoid costly strategies such as rival violence. Results confirmed these hypotheses. Dominance-oriented individuals imposed costs on their partners and intrasexual rivals; prestige-oriented individuals, in contrast, attempted to increase their partners’ satisfaction by enhancing positive aspects of their relationships. These results suggest that romantic partners engage in strategic mate retention tactics corresponding with their dispositional levels of dominance and prestige motivation.

  {"id":"conroy2016","abstract":"Introduction: Power imbalances within sexual relationships have signiﬁcant implications for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. Little is known about how power inﬂuences the quality of a relationship, which could be an important pathway leading to healthy behavior around HIV/AIDS.\nMethods: This paper uses data from 448 heterosexual couples (896 individuals) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa who completed baseline surveys from 2012 to 2014 as part of a couples-based HIV intervention trial. Using an actor-partner interdependence perspective, we assessed: (1) how both partners' perceptions of power inﬂuences their own (i.e., actor effect) and their partner's reports of relationship quality (i.e., partner effect); and (2) whether these associations differed by gender. We examined three constructs related to power (female power, male equitable gender norms, and shared power) and four domains of relationship quality (intimacy, trust, mutually constructive communication, and conﬂict).\nResults: For actor effects, shared power was strongly and consistently associated with higher relationship quality across all four domains. The effect of shared power on trust, mutually constructive communication, and conﬂict were stronger for men than women. The ﬁndings for female power and male equitable gender norms were more mixed. Female power was positively associated with women's reports of trust and mutually constructive communication, but negatively associated with intimacy. Male equitable gender norms were positively associated with men's reports of mutually constructive communication. For partner effects, male equitable gender norms were positively associated with women's reports of intimacy and negatively associated with women's reports of conﬂict.\nConclusions: Research and health interventions aiming to improving HIV-related behaviors should consider sources of shared power within couples and potential leverage points for empowerment at the couple level. Efforts solely focused on empowering women should also take the dyadic environment and men's perspectives into account to ensure positive relationship outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Conroy","given":"Amy A."},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Nuala"},{"family":"Rooyen","given":"Heidi","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hosegood","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mallory O."},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Marr","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Ngubane","given":"Thulani"},{"family":"Darbes","given":"Lynae A."}],"citation-key":"conroy2016","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.035","ISSN":"02779536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Power and the association with relationship quality in south african couples: implications for HIV/AIDS interventions","title-short":"Power and the association with relationship quality in south african couples","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953616300363","volume":"153"},
  {"id":"cooke2020","abstract":"Rape myths are attitudes that implicitly and explicitly blame victims for their own sexual victimization. Greater adherence to rape myths is linked to several negative outcomes, including the neutralization of gender-based violence and the perpetration of sexual violence. Few studies have considered how previous life experiences and individual-level traits influence the development and greater adherence to rape myths. The current study examines how traits associated with the three-factor model of psychopathy (i.e., egocentric, callous, and antisocial dimensions) and adherence to traditional gender roles mediate the relationship between prior childhood/adolescent victimization and the acceptance of rape myths in a sample of college men and women (N = 789). Path modeling indicates that experiences of psychological victimization (before age 16) increased egocentric psychopathic traits, which then increased the acceptance of rape myths in men. In women, however, sexual victimization (before age 16) increased the acceptance of traditional gender roles, which then influenced the acceptance of rape myths. Additionally, the egocentric facet of psychopathy exerted indirect effects on the acceptance of rape myths through traditional views on gender roles in both men and women. These findings highlight the need to continue to examine egocentric personality traits in relation to the development of rape myths in adolescent and young adult populations. Directions for collegiate programming are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooke","given":"Eric M."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Richard H."},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Brittany E."},{"family":"Bouffard","given":"Leana A."},{"family":"Boisvert","given":"Danielle L."},{"family":"Wells","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Kavish","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Woeckener","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Todd A."}],"citation-key":"cooke2020","container-title":"Journal of Interpersonal Violence","container-title-short":"J Interpers Violence","DOI":"10.1177/0886260520966669","ISSN":"0886-2605","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,18]]},"language":"en","page":"0886260520966669","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc; https://web.archive.org/web/20211207121439/https://journals.sagepub.com/action/cookieAbsent","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Examining the relationship between victimization, psychopathy, and the acceptance of rape myths","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520966669"},

Family stress and low adolescent self-regulation have been linked with increased engagement in risky sexual behaviors, which peak in late adolescence and early adulthood.

We assessed these relationships in a 4-year longitudinal sample of 450 adolescents (52 % female; 70 % white) and their parents using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that high family financial stress predicts engagement in risky sexual behaviors as mediated, but not moderated, by adolescent self-regulation.

An association between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and insecure forms of adult attachment marked by high relationship anxiety has been repeatedly observed in the empirical literature. Aggression also has been linked to insecure attachment. The present study extends previous work by exploring the degree to which the underlying attachment dimensions of relationship anxiety and avoidance are associated in BPD with the following forms of hostility: (a) direct aggression (verbal or physical) initiated towards others, (b) expectation/perception of aggression from others (including “reactive” counteraggression when/if provoked), (c) aggression directed towards the self in the form of suicidality or parasuicidality, and (d) affective experience of irritability or anger. The issue was studied in a sample of 92 patients diagnosed with BPD. Results show significant association between more fearful forms of attachment (simultaneous presence of relationship anxiety and avoidance) and the more reactive form of aggression involving expectation of hostility from others. Self-harm was significantly associated only with relational avoidance while anger and irritability were associated only with relational anxiety.

We investigated three principles that guide moral judgments: (a) Harm caused by action is worse than harm caused by omission, (b) harm intended as the means to a goal is worse than harm foreseen as the side effect of a goal, and (c) harm involving physical contact with the victim is worse than harm involving no physical contact. Asking whether these principles are invoked to explain moral judgments, we found that subjects generally appealed to the ﬁrst and third principles in their justiﬁcations, but not to the second. This ﬁnding has significance for methods and theories of moral psychology: The moral principles used in judgment must be directly compared with those articulated in justiﬁcation, and doing so shows that some moral principles are available to conscious reasoning whereas others are not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cushman","given":"Fiery"},{"family":"Young","given":"Liane"},{"family":"Hauser","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"cushman2006","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01834.x","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1082-1089","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The role of conscious reasoning and intuition in moral judgment: testing three principles of harm","title-short":"The role of conscious reasoning and intuition in moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01834.x","volume":"17"},

We contend that individual differences in the sexual self-view represent an important cognitive diathesis for predicting sexual difficulty or dysfunction.

Next, we describe how diathesis–stress models of psychopathology have been applied to the sexual arena, and discuss the critical features of clinically useful diathesis variables. Drawing from these criteria, we examine the diathetic properties of sexual self-schemas.

Analyses showed that low satisfaction with the relationship was associated with more risky unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). High commitment to the relationship was associated with more practice of negotiated safety (i.e., having safe UAI after both partners have tested negative for HIV and have reached sexual safety agreements). High relationship investment was associated with more risky UAI (borderline significant).

  {"id":"dejong2020","abstract":"Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an ‘everyday life’ context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"DeJong","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Skyler J."},{"family":"Cox","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"dejong2020","container-title":"Criminal Justice Studies","DOI":"10.1080/1478601x.2020.1786278","ISSN":"1478-601X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1478601X.2020.1786278","page":"195-212","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Male rape in context: measures of intolerance and support for male rape myths (MRMs)","title-short":"Male rape in context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1478601X.2020.1786278","volume":"33"},

Power is a central construct in economic decision making, inﬂuencing people’s thoughts and behavior in organizational, political, consumer, and interpersonal contexts. Whereas most research has discussed ways that power can inﬂuence primary cognition (e.g., increased self-focused thoughts, heuristic processing), we examine how power can inﬂuence secondary cognition (i.e., thinking about thinking). We argue that high (relative to low) power can increase reliance on one’s current thoughts, magnifying their inﬂuence on judgment. If thoughts are antisocial (prosocial), increased power will produce more antisocial (prosocial) judgments and behavior. We activated prosocial or antisocial concepts through priming before activating powerfulness or powerlessness.

Structural equation modeling was used for the analyses. Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported condom use. Results: Theoretical associations yielded a well-fitting structural model across initial and cross-validation samples. A significant amount of variance was explained for the variables of condom use (R2 ϭ .31, .18), partner communication (R2 ϭ .30, .26), substance use during sex (R2 ϭ .32, .51), and negative personal affect (R2 ϭ .36, .48). Partner communication (.35, .38) was the strongest predictor of condom use, negative personal affect (Ϫ.41, Ϫ.37) was the strongest predictor of partner communication, and physical risk (.54, .54) was the strongest predictor of negative personal affect.

  {"id":"desanjose2008","abstract":"Objectives\nThe AFRODITA study was designed to describe patterns relating to the number of lifetime sexual partners (SP) and age at first sexual intercourse (AFSI) by geographic region in a representative sample of Spanish women.\nStudy design\nA representative sample of the female Spanish population was obtained using the Access Panel Technique. Postal questionnaires were sent to 11,086 women aged 18–70 years. Data were collected on AFSI, number of sexual partners, contraceptive methods, cervical cancer screening and socio-demographic characteristics.\nResults\nThe average AFSI was 20.9 years. AFSI below the age of 19 years was reported by 30.8% of the women. Among sexually active women, 70.6% reported being monogamous and 6.4% reported ≥5 lifetime sexual partners. Younger age at interview was strongly related to earlier AFSI and to higher number of lifetime sexual partners. Women younger than 25 were 39 times more likely to have an AFSI before age 18 than women over age 55. The percentage of women aged less than 25 reporting two or more sexual partners was four times higher than that of women 56 and older. In the multivariate analysis, having two or more sexual partners was independently associated with young age, early AFSI, having ever used oral contraceptives, living in an urban area, having had a screening Pap test in the last 3 years, having a sexually transmitted infection and nuliparity.\nConclusions\nThis study confirms important changes in the sexual behaviour of Spanish women. Younger cohorts show a younger age at sexual initiation and higher number of sexual partners.

  {"id":"dickson1998","abstract":"Objectives: To investigate how age at first sexual intercourse is related to the reported circumstances and to determine how these corresponded to views in early adulthood about its timing.\nDesign: Cross sectional study within a birth cohort using a questionnaire presented by computer.\nSetting: Dunedin, New Zealand in 1993-4.\nSubjects: 477 men and 458 women enrolled in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, comprising 92% of survivors of the cohort.\nResults: The median age at first intercourse was 17 years for men and 16 years for women. Only one man (0.2%) but 30 (7%) women reported being forced to have intercourse on the first occasion. For women, there were increasing rates of coercion with younger age at first intercourse. More men than women reported that they and their partner were equally willing (77% (316/413) v 53% (222/419)). Mutual willingness of both partners was greater for those who reported that it was also the first time for their partner. Timing of first intercourse was considered about right by 49% (200/411) of men and 38% (148/388) of women. Many women (54% (211/388) reported that they should have waited longer, and this rose to 70% (90/129) for women reporting intercourse before age 16.\nConclusions: Most women regretted having sexual intercourse before age 16. First intercourse at younger ages is associated with risks that are shared unequally between men and women. This information is important to young people themselves.\n\nKey messages We questioned a cohort of young New Zealand adults about the circumstances of their first sexual intercourse and their views about the timing of first intercourseMedian age at first intercourse was 17 years for men and 16 years for women.Being forced at first intercourse was commonly reported by women, especially those who experienced intercourse before age 14, and most women who had intercourse before age 16 reported that they should have waited longerMore men than women said that both they and their partner were equally willing at first intercourse, and reporting of equal willingness was greater among those who reported that it was also the first sexual intercourse for their partnerAs well as pronounced gender differences in mutual willingness and retrospective views of appropriate timing, more women reported occurrence of sexually transmitted disease, especially among those who had intercourse before age 16","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dickson","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Herbison","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Phil"}],"citation-key":"dickson1998","container-title":"BMJ","container-title-short":"BMJ","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.316.7124.29","ISSN":"0959-8138, 1468-5833","issue":"7124","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,1,3]]},"language":"en","page":"29-33","PMID":"9451263","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","section":"Paper","source":"www.bmj.com","title":"First sexual intercourse: age, coercion, and later regrets reported by a birth cohort","title-short":"First sexual intercourse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.bmj.com/content/316/7124/29","volume":"316"},

  {"id":"dienes2020","abstract":"This article provides guidance on interpreting and reporting Bayesian hypothesis tests, in order to aid their understanding. To use and report a Bayesian hypothesis test, predicted effect sizes must be specified. The paper will provide guidance in specifying effect sizes of interest (which also will be of relevance to those using frequentist statistics).  First, if a minimally interesting effect size can be specified, a null interval is defined as the effects smaller in magnitude than the minimally interesting effect.  Then the proportion of the posterior distribution that falls in the null interval indicates the plausibility of the null interval hypothesis. Second, if a rough scale of effect can be determined, a Bayes factor can indicate evidence for a model representing that scale of effect versus a model of H0. Both methods allow data to count against a theory that predicts a difference. By contrast, non-significance does not count against such a theory. Various examples are provided including the suitability of Bayesian analyses for demonstrating the absence of conscious perception under putative subliminal conditions, and its presence in supraliminal conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dienes","given":"Zoltan"}],"citation-key":"dienes2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/bua5n","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,3]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"How to use and report bayesian hypothesis tests","type":"report","URL":"https://psyarxiv.com/bua5n/"},

For example, are the wealthy more or less likely to accept an unfair offer in an ultimatum game where it is costly to reject an unfair offer? How about when it is not costly to reject an unfair offer? In the present research, we measured self-reported wealth (i.e., family income, Studies 1–3) and manipulated wealth using a “lucky draw” game (Studies 2 and 3) to examine how wealth affects responses to unfairness in an ultimatum game (Studies 1–3) and a new game called the cost-free rejection game (CFRG, Study 3). Across three studies, we found that wealthy people rejected an unfair offer (i.e., being offered 20% while the other kept 80% of the endowment) more frequently than the less wealthy, and that this tendency to reject unfairness was mediated by their increased feelings of entitlement. This suggests that the wealthy, or even people who temporarily perceive themselves to be wealthy, are more easily offended by unfairness than the less wealthy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Junhui"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Van Lange","given":"Paul A.

Subsequently, subjects negotiated through computers with opponents (in reality, simulated by a computer), who sent compellent threats or promises designed to induce some desired behavior.

This possibility is particularly stark in Bayesian hypothesis testing: To use this increasingly popular approach, researchers specify the effect size they are expecting (the “prior mean”), which is then incorporated into the final statistical results. Because the prior mean represents an expression of confidence that one is studying a large effect, we reasoned that scientists who are more confident in their research skills may be inclined to select larger prior means. Across two preregistered studies with more than 900 active researchers in psychology, we showed that more self-confident researchers selected larger prior means. We also found suggestive but somewhat inconsistent evidence that men may choose larger prior means than women, due in part to gender differences in researcher self-confidence.

  {"id":"ebenbach1998","abstract":"This investigation examined whether ideological opponents' emotion and relative power in a conflict would influence the accuracy with which they judge their own side's and their opponents' attitudes. Based on accounts linking power and emotion to perceptual vigilance, we proposed that opposing partisans will be prone to stereotype their opponents as extremists, as the result of a heuristic, effort-saving strategy, unless motivated by lower relative power or increased emotion to make more accurate judgments. We predicted that members of powerful groups would judge the views of other groups inaccurately, that all groups would have inaccurate views of less powerful groups, and that high levels of negative emotion with regard to the conflict would be associated with more accurate judgments. Two studies yielded certain findings consistent with these predictions. In Study 1, powerful majority partisans were less accurate judges but more accurately judged than less powerful minority partisans across two social issues. Study 2 focused on two activist groups embroiled in a conflict over status and funding within the university setting, the power being held a Gay Pride group. Consistent with hypotheses, a self-reported sense of power and reduced negative emotion were both associated with reduced judgmental accuracy. Discussion focused on the underlying mechanisms that might account for the effects of power and emotion upon social judgment and the social implications of these asymmetries in judgmental accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ebenbach","given":"David H."},{"family":"Keltner","given":"Dacher"}],"citation-key":"ebenbach1998","container-title":"Basic and Applied Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1207/s15324834basp2001_2","ISSN":"0197-3533","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,3,1]]},"page":"7-21","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Power, emotion, and judgmental accuracy in social conflict: motivating the cognitive miser","title-short":"Power, emotion, and judgmental accuracy in social conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15324834basp2001_2","volume":"20"},

After defining a reciprocal power-dependence relation, attention is focused upon properties of balance and \"balancing operations\" in such relations. The theory dictates exactly four generic types of balancing process, and discussion of these leads directly into processes of group formation, including the emergence of group norms, role structure and status hierarchy, all presented as the outcome of balancing tendencies in power relations. Within the framework of this theory, authority appears quite naturally to be legitimized power, vested in roles, and \"legitimation\" is seen as a special case of the coalition process through which norms and role-prescriptions are formed. Finally, through treating both persons and groups as actors in a power-network (two or more connected power-dependence relations) the door is opened for meaningful analysis of complex power structures.

  {"id":"eskine2011","abstract":"Can sweet-tasting substances trigger kind, favorable judgments about other people? What about substances that are disgusting and bitter? Various studies have linked physical disgust to moral disgust, but despite the rich and sometimes striking findings these studies have yielded, no research has explored morality in conjunction with taste, which can vary greatly and may differentially affect cognition. The research reported here tested the effects of taste perception on moral judgments. After consuming a sweet beverage, a bitter beverage, or water, participants rated a variety of moral transgressions. Results showed that taste perception significantly affected moral judgments, such that physical disgust (induced via a bitter taste) elicited feelings of moral disgust. Further, this effect was more pronounced in participants with politically conservative views than in participants with politically liberal views.Taken together, these differential findings suggest that embodied gustatory experiences may affect moral processing more than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Eskine","given":"Kendall J."},{"family":"Kacinik","given":"Natalie A."},{"family":"Prinz","given":"Jesse J."}],"citation-key":"eskine2011","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797611398497","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3]]},"language":"en","page":"295-299","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A bad taste in the mouth: gustatory disgust influences moral judgment","title-short":"A bad taste in the mouth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611398497","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"evans2021","abstract":"One of the most interesting findings in multialternative, multiattribute choice is the occurrence of “context effects,” where the relative preference between two alternatives is influenced by a third, decoy alternative. Although context effects have been well documented, the circumstances necessary for them to occur is a puzzle. Sometimes, the effects disappear or reverse, suggesting they are fragile. We hypothesize this fragility is partly due to a sequential comparison process where subsets of options are compared and evaluated during deliberation. Thus, manipulating the comparison of options (by manipulating presentation order of options) should influence the manifestation of these effect. We test this hypothesis in two ways for the attraction effect. First, we develop a temporally sequential version of a well-established perceptual context effects paradigm, where participants only see 1 alternative at a time. Results show that presentation order strongly influences choices. In some orders, a standard attraction effect occurs and in others, a reversal (or “repulsion”) effect occurs. A piecewise extension of the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator model explains our results by showing how forgetting (due to the sequential presentation) influences the comparison of options. Quantitative fitting demonstrates that the model explains well the data, outperforming alternative heuristic models. Second, we reanalyze attraction effect data from Trueblood et al. (2015) where the spatial order of options was manipulated. Similar to the sequential task, results show a complex pattern of attraction and repulsion effects. Taken together, these results indicate that a malleable comparison process contributes to the fragility of context effects.

  {"id":"fadda2016","abstract":"This paper adds to the growing research on moral judgment (MJ) by considering whether theory of mind (ToM) might foster children’s autonomous MJ achievement. A group of 30 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was compared in MJ and ToM with 30 typically developing (TD) children. Participants were tested for MJ with a classical Piaget’s task and for ToM with a second order False Belief task. In the moral task, children were told two versions of a story: in one version the protagonist acted according to a moral intention but the action resulted in a harmful consequence; in the other version the protagonist acted according to an immoral intention, but the action resulted in a harmless consequence. Children were asked which of the two protagonists was the “naughtier.” In line with previous studies, the results indicated that, while the majority of TD participants succeeded in the second order False Belief task, only few individuals with ASD showed intact perspective taking abilities. The analysis of the MJ in relation to ToM showed that children with ASD lacking ToM abilities judged guilty the protagonists of the two versions of the story in the moral task because both of them violated a moral rule or because they considered the consequences of the actions, ignoring any psychological information. These results indicate a heteronomous morality in individuals with ASD, based on the respect of learned moral rules and outcomes rather than others’ subjective states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fadda","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Parisi","given":"Marinella"},{"family":"Ferretti","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Saba","given":"Gessica"},{"family":"Foscoliano","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Salvago","given":"Azzurra"},{"family":"Doneddu","given":"Giuseppe"}],"citation-key":"fadda2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00523","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]]},"PMCID":"PMC4834434","PMID":"27148131","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Exploring the role of theory of mind in moral judgment: the case of children with autism spectrum disorder","title-short":"Exploring the role of theory of mind in moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834434/","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"fehr2002","abstract":"This paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking. The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. We call this behavioral propensity “strong reciprocity” and show empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a Prisoner’s Dilemma game with a third person. This suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation (in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehr","given":"Ernst"},{"family":"Fischbacher","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Gächter","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"fehr2002","container-title":"Human Nature","container-title-short":"Hum Nat","DOI":"10.1007/s12110-002-1012-7","ISSN":"1936-4776","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-25","source":"Springer Link","title":"Strong reciprocity, human cooperation, and the enforcement of social norms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-002-1012-7","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"fehr2006","abstract":"Most economic models are based on the self-interest hypothesis that assumes that material self-interest exclusively motivates all people. Experimental economists have gathered overwhelming evidence in recent years, however, that systematically refutes the self-interest hypothesis, suggesting that concerns for altruism, fairness, and reciprocity strongly motivate many people. Moreover, several theoretical papers demonstrate that the observed phenomena can be explained in a rigorous and tractable manner. These theories then induced a first wave of experimental research which offered exciting insights into both the nature of preferences and the relative performance of competing fairness theories. The purpose of this chapter is to review these developments, to point out open questions, and to suggest avenues for future research. We also discuss recent neuroeconomic evidence that is consistent with the view that many people have a taste for mutual cooperation and the punishment of norm violators. We further illustrate the powerful impact of fairness concerns on cooperation, competition, incentives, and contract design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehr","given":"Ernst"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Klaus M."}],"citation-key":"fehr2006","collection-title":"Foundations","container-title":"Handbook of the Economics of Giving, Altruism and Reciprocity","DOI":"10.1016/S1574-0714(06)01008-6","editor":[{"family":"Kolm","given":"Serge-Christophe"},{"family":"Ythier","given":"Jean Mercier"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"615-691","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 8 the economics of fairness, reciprocity and altruism – experimental evidence and new theories","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574071406010086","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"feinberg2012","abstract":"A classic problem in moral psychology concerns whether and when moral judgments are driven by intuition versus deliberate reasoning. In this investigation, we explored the role of reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy that involves construing an emotion-eliciting situation in a way that diminishes the intensity of the emotional experience. We hypothesized that although emotional reactions evoke initial moral intuitions, reappraisal weakens the influence of these intuitions, leading to more deliberative moral judgments. Three studies of moral judgments in emotionally evocative, disgust-eliciting moral dilemmas supported our hypothesis. A greater tendency to reappraise was related to fewer intuition-based judgments (Study 1). Content analysis of open-ended descriptions of moral-reasoning processes revealed that reappraisal was associated with longer time spent in deliberation and with fewer intuitionist moral judgments (Study 2). Finally, in comparison with participants who simply watched an emotion-inducing film, participants who had been instructed to reappraise their reactions while watching the film subsequently reported less intense emotional reactions to moral dilemmas, and these dampened reactions led, in turn, to fewer intuitionist moral judgments (Study 3).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Feinberg","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Willer","given":"Robb"},{"family":"Antonenko","given":"Olga"},{"family":"John","given":"Oliver P."}],"citation-key":"feinberg2012","container-title":"Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1177/0956797611434747","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"788-795","source":"JSTOR","title":"Liberating reason from the passions: overriding intuitionist moral judgments through emotion reappraisal","title-short":"Liberating reason from the passions","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/23262496","volume":"23"},

After practicing both tasks separately, participants received feedback on their single-task tracking performance and predicted their dual-task tracking performance before finally performing the 2 tasks simultaneously. Most participants correctly predicted reductions in tracking performance under dual-task conditions, with a majority overestimating the costs of dual-tasking. However, the between-subjects correlation between predicted and actual performance decrements was near 0.

We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an ‘affect heuristic’ which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source—affective reactions to the stimulus item.

At a later session, stimulus people were depicted by category labels (occupations) and relevant attributes (traits) in varying combinations. Typicality ratings confirmed the manipulated ease of categorizing the various information combinations. Correlations between subjects' evaluations of each stimulus person and their independent prior ratings of the components supported the idea of a continuum anchored respectively by relatively category-based and by relatively attribute-based impression formation processes. In the second study, think-aloud data further supported the current hypotheses: subjects spontaneously examined the fit between category and attributes, and they used the attributes more in the attribute-based conditions than in the category-based conditions. The protocol data also reveal some processes intermediate on the continuum between primarily category-based and primarily attribute-based processes; these include subcategorizing, generating new categories, and self-reference.

  {"id":"fiske2007","abstract":"Like all perception, social perception reflects evolutionary pressures. In encounters with conspecifics, social animals must determine, immediately, whether the ‘other’ is friend or foe (i.e. intends good or ill) and, then, whether the ‘other’ has the ability to enact those intentions. New data confirm these two universal dimensions of social cognition: warmth and competence. Promoting survival, these dimensions provide fundamental social structural answers about competition and status. People perceived as warm and competent elicit uniformly positive emotions and behavior, whereas those perceived as lacking warmth and competence elicit uniform negativity. People classified as high on one dimension and low on the other elicit predictable, ambivalent affective and behavioral reactions.

For good reasons, people object to being stereotyped, categorized, and attributed certain characteristics in common. People do not want to be stereotyped because it limits their freedom and constrains their outcomes, even their lives. In short, stereotypes exert control. Obviously, stereotypes exert control through prejudice and discrimination. Victims of stereotyping know this and rightly resist stereotypes for those reasons.

Observers read stories about a game of backgammon in which the male target either strongly wished for one particular outcome of the roll of the dice or was indifferent and in which either the target rolled the dice himself or a third party rolled the dice for him. Results showed that when the target desired a particular consequence of the dice roll in advance and rolled the dice himself, observers were more likely to see him as having exerted influence over the dice roll, were willing to wager more that he could roll the same number again, and rated luck as less influential in producing the dice roll outcome.

  {"id":"fleming2012","abstract":"Neuroscience has made considerable progress in understanding the neural substrates supporting cognitive performance in a number of domains, including memory, perception, and decision making. In contrast, how the human brain generates metacognitive awareness of task performance remains unclear. Here, we address this question by asking participants to perform perceptual decisions while providing concurrent metacognitive reports during fMRI scanning. We show that activity in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) satisfies three constraints for a role in metacognitive aspects of decision-making. Right rlPFC showed greater activity during self-report compared to a matched control condition, activity in this region correlated with reported confidence, and the strength of the relationship between activity and confidence predicted metacognitive ability across individuals. In addition, functional connectivity between right rlPFC and both contralateral PFC and visual cortex increased during metacognitive reports. We discuss these findings in a theoretical framework where rlPFC re-represents object-level decision uncertainty to facilitate metacognitive report.","author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"S.

  {"id":"fleming2017","abstract":"People are often aware of their mistakes, and report levels of confidence in their choices that correlate with objective performance. These metacognitive assessments of decision quality are important for the guidance of behavior, particularly when external feedback is absent or sporadic. However, a computational framework that accounts for both confidence and error detection is lacking. In addition, accounts of dissociations between performance and metacognition have often relied on ad hoc assumptions, precluding a unified account of intact and impaired self-evaluation. Here we present a general Bayesian framework in which self-evaluation is cast as a “second-order” inference on a coupled but distinct decision system, computationally equivalent to inferring the performance of another actor. Second-order computation may ensue whenever there is a separation between internal states supporting decisions and confidence estimates over space and/or time. We contrast second-order computation against simpler first-order models in which the same internal state supports both decisions and confidence estimates. Through simulations we show that second-order computation provides a unified account of different types of self-evaluation often considered in separate literatures, such as confidence and error detection, and generates novel predictions about the contribution of one’s own actions to metacognitive judgments. In addition, the model provides insight into why subjects’ metacognition may sometimes be better or worse than task performance. We suggest that second-order computation may underpin self-evaluative judgments across a range of domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Daw","given":"Nathaniel D."}],"citation-key":"fleming2017","container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychological Review","DOI":"10.1037/rev0000045","ISSN":"1939-1471, 0033-295X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"language":"en","page":"91-114","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Self-evaluation of decision-making: A general bayesian framework for metacognitive computation.","title-short":"Self-evaluation of decision-making","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/rev0000045","volume":"124"},

We investigate the role of negative assortment in the evolution of fair play in the ultimatum game. Spite—social behaviour that inflicts harm with no direct benefit to the actor—can evolve when it is disproportionally directed at individuals playing different strategies. The introduction of negative assortment alters the dynamics in a way that increases the chance fairness evolves, but at a cost: spite also evolves. Fairness is usually linked to cooperation and prosocial behaviour, but this study shows that it may have evolutionary links to harmful antisocial behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Forber","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Smead","given":"Rory"}],"citation-key":"forber2014","container-title":"Proceedings: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2013.2439","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1780","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"1-8","source":"JSTOR","title":"The evolution of fairness through spite","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/43600393","volume":"281"},

Participants read one of four brief vignettes in which the betrayed person slapped his/her partner and made his/her lip bleed. Justification of this action was rated on 10 items. Factor analysis of these items indicated the presence of three factors for men and four for women. Both men and women indicated that hitting the partner, getting even, and being angry were more justifiable following a sexual betrayal. The hitting of a male partner by a betrayed woman was perceived as more justified than the hitting of a female partner by a betrayed man. In absolute terms, hitting and getting even by both women and men were generally viewed as unjustifiable, whereas being angry was viewed as justifiable. For both women and men, scores on the Vengeance Scale (Stuckless & Goranson, 1992) and Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1995) were related to getting even. For men, the Hostile Sexism Scale (Glick & Fiske, 2001) was related to getting even or being angry and breaking up. Results indicated that perceptions of reactions to betrayal are related to type of betrayal and to the dispositional characteristics of the perceiver.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Forbes","given":"Gordon B."},{"family":"Jobe","given":"Rebecca L."},{"family":"White","given":"Kay B."},{"family":"Bloesch","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Adams-Curtis","given":"Leah E."}],"citation-key":"forbes2005","container-title":"Sex Roles","container-title-short":"Sex Roles","DOI":"10.1007/s11199-005-1292-6","ISSN":"1573-2762","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,2,1]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"165-173","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers; https://web.archive.org/web/20211213130100/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-005-1292-6","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Perceptions of dating violence following a sexualor nonsexual betrayal of trust: effects of gender, sexism, acceptance of rape myths, and vengeance motivation","title-short":"Perceptions of dating violence following a sexualor nonsexual betrayal of trust","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-005-1292-6","volume":"52"},

Gilligan (1982) that there are 2 conceptions of morality—one described as a morality of justice, on which Kohlberg's scheme is based, and one described as a morality of care, seen by Gilligan as more representative of female thinking about moral conflict—were studied. 101 male and 101 female undergraduates filled out a self-report questionnaire on moral dilemmas they had experienced. They then rated their use of both justice and care orientations in resolving those dilemmas. Ss also completed the Interpersonal Disposition Inventory and semantic differential items. The use of the 2 orientations was examined in relationship to S gender, sex role, and perceptions of the 2 orientations. Few significant differences were obtained, except that female Ss were more consistent in their use of a care orientation and male Ss were more consistent in their use of a justice orientation. More feminine males were more likely to report the use of a care orientation than less feminine males. Male and female reasoning about moral conflict is examined in the light of these 2 perspectives, and the relationship of sex roles to endorsement of each perspective is discussed.

  {"id":"forgas2021","abstract":"The recent rise of populist politics represent a major challenge for liberal democracies. This important book explores the psychological reasons for the rise of populism, featuring contributions from leading international researchers in the fields of psychology and political science. Unlike liberal democracy based on the Enlightenment values of individual freedom, autonomy and rationality, both right-wing and left-wing populism offer collectivist, autocratic formulations reminiscent of the evolutionary history and tribal instincts of our species. The book offers a comprehensive overview of the psychology of populism, covering such phenomena as identity seeking, anger and fear, collective narcissism, grievance, norms, perceptions of powerlessness and deprivation, authoritarianism, nationalism, radicalism, propaganda and persuasion, ethnocentrism, xenophobia and the effects of globalization.  The book is divided into four parts. Part I deals with the motivational and emotional factors that attract voters to populist causes, and the human needs and values that populist movements satisfy. Part II analyzes the cognitive features of populist appeals, especially their emphasis on simplicity, epistemic certainty and moral absolutism. Part III turns to one of the defining features of populism: its offer of a powerful tribal identity and collectivist ideology that provide meaning and personal significance to its followers. Finally, in Part IV, the propaganda tactics used by populist movements are analysed, including the role of charismatic leadership, authoritarianism, and nationalism and the use of conspiracy narratives and persuasive strategies. This is fascinating reading on a highly topical issue. The book will be of interest to students, researchers, and applied professionals in all areas of psychology and the social sciences as a textbook or reference book, and to anyone interested in the global rise of populism.","author":[{"family":"Forgas","given":"Joseph P."},{"family":"Crano","given":"William D."},{"family":"Fiedler","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"forgas2021","ISBN":"978-1-00-036893-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,19]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"334","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"The psychology of populism: the tribal challenge to liberal democracy","title-short":"The psychology of populism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"garofalo2019","abstract":"Psychopathy has long been conceptualized in terms of an absence of emotion. Yet, recent studies have suggested that the experience of other-directed negative emotions may be more intimately linked to psychopathy than previously acknowledged, although there is limited knowledge concerning the experience of such emotions. The present study examined the disposition to experience two other-directed emotions, spitefulness and contempt, that are conceptually linked with psychopathy but currently are limited in empirical support. Across 2 studies with 3 nonclinical samples (Ns ϭ 1,237, 239, 521), we found evidence that psychopathic traits—as assessed via the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (SRP; Paulhus, Neumann, & Hare, 2016; Study 1 and Study 2) and the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM; Patrick, 2010; Study 2)—were positively associated with spitefulness (Study 1) and contempt (Study 2). These associations were consistent across psychopathy instruments (SRP and TriPM) and dimensions (i.e., the SRP Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle, and Antisocial facets, and the TriPM Meanness and Disinhibition dimensions), were stronger for the interpersonal and affective traits of psychopathy, and held when accounting for several theoretically relevant covariates. The only exception concerned the TriPM Boldness scale, which had less consistent associations with contempt. The present findings further our understanding of the emotional experiences related to psychopathy, highlighting the relevance of focusing on other-directed negative emotions, especially those that are interpersonal in nature and share an antagonistic component.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Garofalo","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Craig S."},{"family":"Zeigler-Hill","given":"Virgil"},{"family":"Meloy","given":"J.

  {"id":"gesink2016","abstract":"STI rates are high for First Nations in Canada and the United States. Our objective was to understand the context, issues, and beliefs around high STI rates from a nêhiyaw (Cree) perspective. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 community participants between March 1, 2011 and May 15, 2011. Interviews were conducted by community researchers and grounded in the Cree values of relationship, sharing, personal agency and relational accountability. A diverse purposive snowball sample of community members were asked why they thought STI rates were high for the community. The remainder of the interview was unstructured, and supported by the interviewer through probes and sharing in a conversational style. Modiﬁed grounded theory was used to analyze the narratives and develop a theory. The main ﬁnding from the interviews was that abuse of power in relationships causes physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wounds that disrupt the medicine wheel. Wounded individuals seek medicine to stop suffering and ﬁnd healing. Many numb suffering by accessing temporary medicines (sex, drugs and alcohol) or permanent medicines (suicide). These medicines increase the risk of STIs. Some seek healing by participating in ceremony and restoring relationships with self, others, Spirit/religion, traditional knowledge and traditional teachings. These medicines decrease the risk of STIs. Younger female participants explained how casual relationships are safer than committed monogamous relationships. Resolving abuse of power in relationships should lead to improvements in STI rates and sexual health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Gesink","given":"Dionne"},{"family":"Whiskeyjack","given":"Lana"},{"family":"Suntjens","given":"Terri"},{"family":"Mihic","given":"Alanna"},{"family":"McGilvery","given":"Priscilla"}],"citation-key":"gesink2016","container-title":"Child Abuse & Neglect","container-title-short":"Child Abuse & Neglect","DOI":"10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.06.005","ISSN":"01452134","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"language":"en","page":"12-23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Abuse of power in relationships and sexual health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0145213416301028","volume":"58"},

Individualistic negotiators were expected to be influenced more by information about the alternative party's strength than prosocial negotiators. 49 dyads were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions in a 2 (Potency of the alternative Negotiator: Low vs High) by 2 (One's Own Motivational Orientation: individualistic vs Prosocial) factorial design. Face-to-face interactions were audiotaped and transcribed. In line with our expectation, individualistically orientated negotiators engaged in problem solving to a lesser extent and communicated more threats and putdowns when the alternative party was perceived as weak and submissive rather than strong and dominant. Within negotiation dyads power asymmetry evoked power struggle. Eventually, however, negotiators with an alternative party outperformed parties lacking an alternative. As expected, prosocially orientated negotiators were less influenced by both the mere presence of an alternative negotiation partner and potency information about the alternative party.

I argue that this crisis follows the failure of widely adopted solutions to psychology’s similar crisis of the 1970s. The untouched root cause is an information-economic one: Too many studies divided by too few publication outlets equals a bottleneck. Articles cannot pass through just by showing theoretical meaning and methodological rigor; their results must appear to support the hypothesis perfectly. Consequently, psychologists must master the art of presenting perfect-looking results just to survive in the profession. This favors aesthetic criteria of presentation in a way that harms science’s search for truth. Shallow standards of statistical perfection distort analyses and undermine the accuracy of cumulative data; narrative expectations encourage dishonesty about the relationship between results and hypotheses; criteria of novelty suppress replication attempts. Concerns about truth in research are emerging in other sciences and may eventually descend on our heads in the form of difficult and insensitive regulations. I suggest a more palatable solution: to open the bottleneck, putting structures in place to reward broader forms of information sharing beyond the exquisite art of present-day journal publication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Giner-Sorolla","given":"Roger"}],"citation-key":"giner-sorolla2012","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10/gf5str","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"language":"en","page":"562-571","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Science or art?

  {"id":"gino2011","abstract":"Across four experimental studies, individuals who were depleted of their self-regulatory resources by an initial act of self-control were more likely to “impulsively cheat” than individuals whose self-regulatory resources were intact. Our results demonstrate that individuals depleted of self-control resources were more likely to behave dishonestly (Study 1). Depletion reduced people’s moral awareness when they faced the opportunity to cheat, which, in turn, was responsible for heightened cheating (Study 2). Individuals high in moral identity, however, did not show elevated levels of cheating when they were depleted (Study 3), supporting our hypothesis that self-control depletion increases cheating when it robs people of the executive resources necessary to identify an act as immoral or unethical. Our results also show that resisting unethical behavior both requires and depletes self-control resources (Study 4).

One such trait, strong reciprocity is a predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish those who violate the norms of cooperation, at personal cost, even when it is implausible to expect that these costs will be repaid. We present evidence supporting strong reciprocity as a schema for predicting and understanding altruism in humans. We show that under conditions plausibly characteristic of the early stages of human evolution, a small number of strong reciprocators could invade a population of self-regarding types, and strong reciprocity is an evolutionary stable strategy. Although most of the evidence we report is based on behavioral experiments, the same behaviors are regularly described in everyday life, for example, in wage setting by firms, tax compliance, and cooperation in the protection of local environmental public goods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gintis","given":"Herbert"},{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Boyd","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Fehr","given":"Ernst"}],"citation-key":"gintis2003","container-title":"Evolution and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Evolution and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/S1090-5138(02)00157-5","ISSN":"1090-5138","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"153-172","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Explaining altruistic behavior in humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513802001575","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"graham2011","abstract":"The moral domain is broader than the empathy and justice concerns assessed by existing measures of moral competence, and it is not just a subset of the values assessed by value inventories. To fill the need for reliable and theoretically grounded measurement of the full range of moral concerns, we developed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire on the basis of a theoretical model of 5 universally available (but variably developed) sets of moral intuitions: Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, Ingroup/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity. We present evidence for the internal and external validity of the scale and the model, and in doing so we present new findings about morality: (a) Comparative model fitting of confirmatory factor analyses provides empirical justification for a 5-factor structure of moral concerns; (b) convergent/discriminant validity evidence suggests that moral concerns predict personality features and social group attitudes not previously considered morally relevant; and (c) we establish pragmatic validity of the measure in providing new knowledge and research opportunities concerning demographic and cultural differences in moral intuitions. These analyses provide evidence for the usefulness of Moral Foundations Theory in simultaneously increasing the scope and sharpening the resolution of psychological views of morality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Nosek","given":"Brian A."},{"family":"Haidt","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Koleva","given":"Spassena"},{"family":"Ditto","given":"Peter H."}],"citation-key":"graham2011","container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0021847","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","page":"366-385","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mapping the moral domain.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0021847","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"grapsas2020","abstract":"We propose a self-regulation model of grandiose narcissism. This model illustrates an interconnected set of processes through which narcissists (i.e., individuals with relatively high levels of grandiose narcissism) pursue social status in their moment-by-moment transactions with their environments. The model shows that narcissists select situations that afford status. Narcissists vigilantly attend to cues related to the status they and others have in these situations and, on the basis of these perceived cues, appraise whether they can elevate their status or reduce the status of others. Narcissists engage in self-promotion (admiration pathway) or other-derogation (rivalry pathway) in accordance with these appraisals. Each pathway has unique consequences for how narcissists are perceived by others, thus shaping their social status over time. The model demonstrates how narcissism manifests itself as a stable and consistent cluster of behaviors in pursuit of social status and how it develops and maintains itself over time. More broadly, the model might offer useful insights for future process models of other personality traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Grapsas","given":"Stathis"},{"family":"Brummelman","given":"Eddie"},{"family":"Back","given":"Mitja D."},{"family":"Denissen","given":"Jaap J.

  {"id":"gray2012","abstract":"Mind perception entails ascribing mental capacities to other entities, whereas moral judgment entails labeling entities as good or bad or actions as right or wrong. We suggest that mind perception is the essence of moral judgment. In particular, we suggest that moral judgment is rooted in a cognitive template of two perceived minds—a moral dyad of an intentional agent and a suffering moral patient. Diverse lines of research support dyadic morality. First, perceptions of mind are linked to moral judgments: dimensions of mind perception (agency and experience) map onto moral types (agents and patients), and deficits of mind perception correspond to difficulties with moral judgment. Second, not only are moral judgments sensitive to perceived agency and experience, but all moral transgressions are fundamentally understood as agency plus experienced suffering—that is, interpersonal harm—even ostensibly harmless acts such as purity violations. Third, dyadic morality uniquely accounts for the phenomena of dyadic completion (seeing agents in response to patients, and vice versa), and moral typecasting (characterizing others as either moral agents or moral patients). Discussion also explores how mind perception can unify morality across explanatory levels, how a dyadic template of morality may be developmentally acquired, and future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Young","given":"Liane"},{"family":"Waytz","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"gray2012","container-title":"Psychological Inquiry","DOI":"10.1080/1047840X.2012.651387","ISSN":"1047-840X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,1]]},"page":"101-124","PMID":"22754268","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Mind perception is the essence of morality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1047840X.2012.651387","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"greene2009","abstract":"In some cases people judge it morally acceptable to sacriﬁce one person’s life in order to save several other lives, while in other similar cases they make the opposite judgment. Researchers have identiﬁed two general factors that may explain this phenomenon at the stimulus level: (1) the agent’s intention (i.e. whether the harmful event is intended as a means or merely foreseen as a side-effect) and (2) whether the agent harms the victim in a manner that is relatively ‘‘direct” or ‘‘personal”. Here we integrate these two classes of ﬁndings. Two experiments examine a novel personalness/directness factor that we call personal force, present when the force that directly impacts the victim is generated by the agent’s muscles (e.g., in pushing). Experiments 1a and b demonstrate the inﬂuence of personal force on moral judgment, distinguishing it from physical contact and spatial proximity. Experiments 2a and b demonstrate an interaction between personal force and intention, whereby the effect of personal force depends entirely on intention. These studies also introduce a method for controlling for people’s real-world expectations in decisions involving potentially unrealistic hypothetical dilemmas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Cushman","given":"Fiery A."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Lisa E."},{"family":"Lowenberg","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Nystrom","given":"Leigh E."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jonathan D."}],"citation-key":"greene2009","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2009.02.001","ISSN":"00100277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6]]},"language":"en","page":"364-371","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pushing moral buttons: the interaction between personal force and intention in moral judgment","title-short":"Pushing moral buttons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027709000420","volume":"111"},

This research has been exceptionally diverse both in its contentand methodology.

Research in moral cognition, then, has progressed by explaining thephenomena that we identify as ‘‘moral’’ (for high-level functional reasons) in terms ofdiverse cognitive components that are not specific to morality.

  {"id":"guo2017","abstract":"Parenting styles are critical for fostering children’s empathy and prosociality. Yet these relations haven’t been well established for Chinese children, and the underlying mechanisms were seldom explored. Drawing upon parental acceptance-rejection theory and empathy-altruism hypothesis, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between perceived parenting styles and altruistic behavior of children, and the intervening role of children’s empathy and the moderating role of in-group and out-group conditions. What is novel about this study is that it contains both survey data and experimental data. Four hundred and ninety-four children (Mage = 8.92 years) completed four simple binary-choice dictator games which are widely used in the study of other-regarding preferences (concerns for the interests of others). These children also reported their perceived parenting styles. And children’s empathy was reported by their mothers. Each child’s altruism score, which was used in the subsequent analyses, was derived from the altruistic choices in these games. Mediation analyses indicated that, when age and gender were controlled for, maternal and paternal emotional warmth were positively associated with children’s altruism via children’s empathy, while maternal and paternal rejection were negatively associated with children’s altruism via children’s empathy. Multi-group analyses showed that the influences of perceived parenting styles on children’s altruistic behavior via children’s empathy were consistent for in-group and out-group conditions. These findings suggest that enhancing parental emotional warmth and reducing parental rejection may foster children’s empathy, which in turn promote children’s altruism. Limitations and future directions of this study were also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Qingke"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Linlin"}],"citation-key":"guo2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01843","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,16]]},"PMCID":"PMC5650632","PMID":"29085324","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The associations between perceived parenting styles, empathy, and altruistic choices in economic games: A study of chinese children","title-short":"The associations between perceived parenting styles, empathy, and altruistic choices in economic games","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5650632/","volume":"8"},

The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it deemphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals and emphasizes instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions).

Sociosexuality (i.e., a measure of the number of restrictions people place on sexual relationships) gained attention in the 1990s among social and evolutionary psychologists, but has not been fully embraced by social scientists investigating interpersonal relationships and individual differences. Our aim is to investigate whether previously documented sex differences in mating strategies can be partially explained by sociosexuality, as a proximate manifestation of sex, by replicating a study about motives to use online dating applications, using an online survey. A first MANCOVA analysis (N = 254 online daters) not controlling for sociosexuality showed a significant main effect for age and sex. Adding sociosexuality to this analysis, a significant main effect of sociosexuality appeared indicating that individuals with a preference for unrestricted sexual relationships are more motivated to use online dating for reasons related to casual sex, whereas individuals who prefer restricted sexual relationships are more motivated to use online dating to find romance. Interestingly, the original main effect for sex and the significant interactions were eliminated. We argue that in social scientific research, scholars should pay more attention to sociosexuality when doing research about mating strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hallam","given":"Lara"},{"family":"De Backer","given":"Charlotte J.

In a comparison of Dominance Scale scores with related constructs of interest, Authority was found to be most closely related to a measure of decision-making power and to social desirability.

They may be described as examples of biological selfishness. The effect consists of two obvious parts: the gains (in fitness) of the victor and the losses of the victim. Attempts to secure the gains are easily understood to be adaptive: this is the fundamental response to what Darwin called the “struggle for existence”. But, considering the more controversial catch-phrase of evolutionary theory—“the survival of the fittest”—it seems to be a neglected question whether the harm delivered to an adversary is always merely an unfortunate consequence of adaptations for survival. Could such harm ever be adaptive in itself ? Or nearer, to the possibility of a test, would we ever expect an animal to be ready to harm itself in order to harm another more ?

  {"id":"hao2016","abstract":"The rationalistic theories of morality emphasize that reasoning plays an important role in moral judgments and prosocial behavior. Theory of mind as a reasoning ability in the mental domain has been considered a facilitator of moral development. The present study examined whether theory of mind was consistently positively associated with morality from middle childhood to late adulthood. Two hundred four participants, including 48 elementary school children, 45 adolescents, 62 younger adults and 49 older adults, completed theory of mind, moral judgment and prosocial behavior tasks. Theory of mind was measured with strange stories that tapped into an understanding of lies, white lies, double bluffs, irony and persuasion. Moral judgments were measured with variants of the trolley dilemma. Prosocial behavior was measured through participants’ performance in an interactive situation in which a helping request was made. The results indicated specific rather than similar developmental trajectories of theory of mind, moral judgments and prosocial behavior. There was a quadratic trend in theory of mind, a combination of quadratic and cubic trends in deontological moral judgments and a linear decline in helping behavior. It is thus suggested that theory of mind may not be associated with morality in an unchanging way during development. Further results indicated that theory of mind and deontological moral judgments were negatively correlated for children, adolescents and older adults but positively correlated for younger adults. Theory of mind and helping behavior were positively correlated for children but negatively correlated for adolescents. However, the relationships disappeared in adulthood. In sum, the present study reveals that theory of mind may be a nice tool for its facilitation of deontological moral judgments and prosocial behavior, but it may also be a nasty tool for its blocking of deontological moral judgments and prosocial behavior. Moreover, theory of mind may be a permanent tool for moral judgment development but a temporary tool for prosocial behavior development. Thus, the present study enriches the rationalistic theories of morality from a developmental perspective. Different relationships between theory of mind and morality from middle childhood to late adulthood are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hao","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yanchun"}],"citation-key":"hao2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Third, we investigate who dehumanizes, notably the personality, ideological, and other individual differences that increase the propensity to see others as less than human. Fourth, we explore when people dehumanize, focusing on transient situational and motivational factors that promote dehumanizing perceptions. Fifth, we examine the consequences of dehumanization, emphasizing its implications for prosocial and antisocial behavior and for moral judgment.

  {"id":"hauser2009","abstract":"Darwin never provided a satisfactory account of altruism, but posed the problem beautifully in light of the logic of natural selection. Hamilton and Williams delivered the necessary satisfaction by appealing to kinship, and Trivers showed that kinship was not necessary as long as the originally altruistic act was conditionally reciprocated. From the late 1970s to the present, the kinship theories in particular have been supported by considerable empirical data and elaborated to explore a number of other social interactions such as cooperation, selfishness and punishment, giving us what is now a rich description of the nature of social relationships among organisms. There are, however, two forms of theoretically possible social interactions—reciprocity and spite—that appear absent or nearly so in non-human vertebrates, despite considerable research efforts on a wide diversity of species. We suggest that the rather weak comparative evidence for these interactions is predicted once we consider the requisite socioecological pressures and psychological mechanisms. That is, a consideration of ultimate demands and proximate prerequisites leads to the prediction that reciprocity and spite should be rare in non-human animals, and common in humans. In particular, reciprocity and spite evolved in humans because of adaptive demands on cooperation among unrelated individuals living in large groups, and the integrative capacities of inequity detection, future-oriented decision-making and inhibitory control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,5]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Hauser","given":"Marc"},{"family":"McAuliffe","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Blake","given":"Peter R."}],"citation-key":"hauser2009","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2009.0116","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1533","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"3255-3266","source":"JSTOR","title":"Evolving the ingredients for reciprocity and spite","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/40485786","volume":"364"},
  {"id":"heekeren2005","abstract":"Moral decision-making is central to everyday social life because the evaluation of the actions of another agent or our own actions made with respect to the norms and values guides our behavior in a community. There is previous evidence that the presence of bodily harm--even if irrelevant for a decision--may affect the decision-making process. While recent neuroimaging studies found a common neural substrate of moral decision-making, the role of bodily harm has not been systematically studied so far. Here we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how behavioral and neural correlates of semantic and moral decision-making processes are modulated by the presence of direct bodily harm or violence in the stimuli. Twelve participants made moral and semantic decisions about sentences describing actions of agents that either contained bodily harm or not and that could easily be judged as being good or bad or correct/incorrect, respectively. During moral and semantic decision-making, the presence of bodily harm resulted in faster response times (RT) and weaker activity in the temporal poles relative to trials devoid of bodily harm/violence, indicating a processing advantage and reduced processing depth for violence-related linguistic stimuli. Notably, there was no increase in activity in the amygdala and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in response to trials containing bodily harm. These findings might be a correlate of limited generation of the semantic and emotional context in the anterior temporal poles during the evaluation of actions of another agent related to violence that is made with respect to the norms and values guiding our behavior in a community.","author":[{"family":"Heekeren","given":"Hauke R."},{"family":"Wartenburger","given":"Isabell"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Helge"},{"family":"Prehn","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Schwintowski","given":"Hans-Peter"},{"family":"Villringer","given":"Arno"}],"citation-key":"heekeren2005","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.026","ISSN":"1053-8119","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,2,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"887-897","PMID":"15652323","source":"PubMed","title":"Influence of bodily harm on neural correlates of semantic and moral decision-making","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"hertz2018","abstract":"Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices' payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants' probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options' payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions' time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a \"stochastic satisficing\" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen option's thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants' decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence. We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making.","author":[{"family":"Hertz","given":"Uri"},{"family":"Bahrami","given":"Bahador"},{"family":"Keramati","given":"Mehdi"}],"citation-key":"hertz2018","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0195399","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","page":"e0195399","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Stochastic satisficing account of confidence in uncertain value-based decisions.(research article)","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Methods Men with mild IDs (n = 35) were asked to complete a measure of general empathy and a measure of specific victim empathy. All participants completed the victim empathy measure in relation to a hypothetical victim of a sexual offence, and a non-sexual crime, while additionally, men with a history of sexual offending were asked to complete this measure in relation to their own most recent victim. Results Men with a history of sexual offending had significantly lower general empathy, and specific victim empathy towards an unknown sexual offence victim, than men with no known history of illegal behaviour. Men with a history of sexual offending had significantly lower victim empathy for their own victim than for an unknown sexual offence victim. Victim empathy towards an unknown victim of a non-sexual crime did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions The findings suggest that it is important include interventions within treatment programmes that attempt to improve empathy and perspective-taking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hockley","given":"O.

  {"id":"hofer2010","abstract":"Research has shown that an individual’s implicit power motive relates to 2 types of behavioral clusters: either prosocial, socially appropriate behaviors or profligate, impulsive behaviors. The present study examined the relationship between individuals’ implicit power motives and their tendency to engage in sexual activities without strong emotional ties (i.e., sociosexuality). For men, but not for women, this relationship was hypothesized to be moderated by an implicit disposition for responsibility. Whereas most research has been limited to Euro-American contexts, the present study examined the relationship between power motive, disposition for responsibility, and sociosexuality among participants recruited in Cameroon, China, Costa Rica, and Germany. Explicit Big Five measures of personality were controlled for. For women, only a main effect of responsibility on sociosexuality was found across cultural groups; for men, the association between power motivation and sociosexuality was moderated by responsibility, independent of cultural group. Traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness were systematically related to lower levels of sociosexuality. Effects for both implicit and explicit measures of personality suggest universality in the processes associated with more enactments of sociosexuality, confirming in part the hypothesized role of responsibility in channeling the realization of the power motive into less impulsive activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofer","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Busch","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Bond","given":"Michael Harris"},{"family":"Campos","given":"Domingo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Law","given":"Ruby"}],"citation-key":"hofer2010","container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0020053","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"380-394","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The implicit power motive and sociosexuality in men and women: pancultural effects of responsibility.","title-short":"The implicit power motive and sociosexuality in men and women","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0020053","volume":"99"},

This theorizing yields four insights into the way emotions shape moral judgment. We submit that there are two kinds of specificity in the impact of emotion upon moral judgment: domain specificity and emotion specificity. We further contend that the unique embodied aspects of an emotion, such as nonverbal expressions and physiological responses, contribute to an emotion’s impact on moral judgment. Finally, emotions play a key role in determining which issues acquire moral significance in a society over time, in a process known as moralization (Rozin, 1999). The implications of these four observations for future research on emotion and morality are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Horberg","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Oveis","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Keltner","given":"Dacher"}],"citation-key":"horberg2011","container-title":"Emotion Review","container-title-short":"Emotion Review","DOI":"10.1177/1754073911402384","ISSN":"1754-0739","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"237-244","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Emotions as moral amplifiers: an appraisal tendency approach to the influences of distinct emotions upon moral judgment","title-short":"Emotions as moral amplifiers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1754073911402384","volume":"3"},

Sexual health education for female adolescents broadens opportunities for nurses to help female adolescents adopt appropriate sexual attitudes and make appropriate decisions.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the effect of sexual empowerment on sexual decision making in female adolescents.\nMethods: Twenty-nine female students with steady boyfriends were invited to participate in a sexual empowerment course. Course activities specifically related to sexual empowerment were audio-tape-recorded. Dialogue content was analyzed, and content provided by each study participant was reconfirmed in face-to-face interviews to understand the entire empowerment process in terms of how such may affect responses and to assess the possibility of correctly reinterpreting findings during the member check process. This study also took into consideration degrees of reliability and rigorousness.\nResults: The four themes found to underlie participant perceptions of their sexual empowerment to make sex-related decisions were as follows: (a) proactively seeking sexual knowledge, (b) reexamining relationships with boyfriends, (c) the right to say ‘‘no’’ and to engage in self-protection, and (d) the need to change sexual attitudes and behaviors.\nConclusions and Implications for Practice: Using the peer group intervention in sexual empowerment may positively impact sexual health decision making in adolescent girls.

Both constructs are positively related to agentic traits and assertive interpersonal approaches, but differ in relation to agreeableness/communion. Self-esteem emerged as a wholly adaptive construct negatively associated with internalizing psychopathology and generally unrelated to externalizing behaviors.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent, has presented a constant challenge for the provision of such therapy as it has demonstrated the ability to become resistant to successive highly active agents chosen for first-line treatment. Acquisition of plasmids from other bacteria and long-term use of a single agent has selected both single step high-level and low-level resistance due to multiple mutations. While therapeutic failure of the current recommended agents cefixime and ceftriaxone begins to emerge, choice of alternative therapies is limited. Guidelines for therapy will be dependent on surveillance programs but individual patient management will require a viable organism to detect emerging resistance. Advances in molecular detection, while advantageous for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, fail to provide a viable organism, posing even greater challenges for the definition of treatment failure, and appropriate end points for test of cure.

  {"id":"johnson2012a","abstract":"The dominance behavioral system (DBS) can be conceptualized as a biologically-based system which guides dominance motivation, dominant and subordinate behavior, and responsivity to perceptions of power and subordination. A growing body of research suggests that problems with the DBS are evident across a broad range of psychopathologies. We begin by describing psychological, social, and biological correlates of the dominance behavioral system (DBS). Extensive research suggests that externalizing disorders, mania-proneness, and narcissistic traits are related to heightened dominance motivation and behaviors. Mania and narcissistic traits also appear related to inflated self-perceptions of power. Anxiety and depression are related to subordination and submissiveness, as well as a desire to avoid subordination. Models of the DBS have received support from research with humans and animals; from self-report, observational, and biological methods; and using naturalistic and experimental paradigms. Limitations of available research include the relative lack of longitudinal studies using multiple measures of the DBS and the absence of relevant studies using diagnosed samples to study narcissistic personality disorder and bipolar disorder. We provide suggestions for future research on the DBS and psychopathology, including investigations of whether the DBS can be used to differentiate specific disorder outcomes; the need for more sophisticated biological research; and the value of longitudinal dynamical research. Implications of using the DBS as a tool in clinical assessment and treatment are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Sheri L."},{"family":"Leedom","given":"Liane J."},{"family":"Muhtadie","given":"Luma"}],"citation-key":"johnson2012a","container-title":"Psychological Bulletin","container-title-short":"Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1037/a0027503","ISSN":"0033-2909","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7]]},"page":"692-743","PMCID":"PMC3383914","PMID":"22506751","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The dominance behavioral system and psychopathology: evidence from self-report, observational, and biological studies","title-short":"The dominance behavioral system and psychopathology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383914/","volume":"138"},
  {"id":"johnson2014","abstract":"Schnall, Benton, and Harvey (2008) hypothesized that physical cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments. In support of this idea, they found that individuals make less severe judgments when they are primed with the concept of cleanliness (Exp. 1) and when they wash their hands after experiencing disgust (Exp. 2). We conducted direct replications of both studies using materials supplied by the original authors. We did not find evidence that physical cleanliness reduced the severity of moral judgments using samples sizes that provided over .99 power to detect the original effect sizes. Our estimates of the overall effect size were much smaller than estimates from Experiment 1 (original d = À0.60, 95% CI [À1.23, 0.04], N = 40; replication d = À0.01, 95% CI [À0.28, 0.26], N = 208) and Experiment 2 (original d = À0.85, 95% CI [À1.47, À0.22], N = 43; replication d = 0.01, 95% CI [À.34, 0.36], N = 126).

  {"id":"johnston1996","abstract":"Clinicians and researchers have noted the important role of maladaptive beliefs and distorted thinking in facilitating or justifying sexual offenses. There have been a number of attempts to describe the nature of these beliefs and to develop ways of measuring them but in the absence of any integrating theory. It is our belief that an understanding of the cognitive processes underlying the initiation, maintenance, and justification of sexual offending is a vital prerequisite to the development of successful treatment programs. The present paper proposes the use of a social cognition framework in considering cognitive processes that may be important contributing factors in the propensity of some men to commit sexual offenses. Pertinent research in the social cognition domain, covering information processing, mental control, and the impact of affective and motivational factors on cognitive processes, is described and related to the sexual offending literature. Implications for clinical practice and suggestions for future research are highlighted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Tony"}],"citation-key":"johnston1996","container-title":"Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment","container-title-short":"Sex Abuse","DOI":"10.1007/BF02258016","ISSN":"1573-286X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"55-80","source":"Springer Link","title":"Social cognition and sexual offending: A theoretical framework","title-short":"Social cognition and sexual offending","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02258016","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"johnstone2006","abstract":"How can cooperation persist in the face of a temptation to 'cheat'? Several recent papers have suggested that the answer may lie in indirect reciprocity. Altruistic individuals may benefit by eliciting altruism from observers, rather than (as in direct reciprocity) from the recipient of the aid they provide. Here, we point out that indirect reciprocity need not always favour cooperation; by contrast, it may support spiteful behaviour, which is costly for the both actor and recipient. Existing theory suggests spite is unlikely to persist, but we demonstrate that it may do so when spiteful individuals are less likely to incur aggression from observers (a negative form of indirect reciprocity)","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnstone","given":"Rufus A."},{"family":"Bshary","given":"Redouan"}],"citation-key":"johnstone2006","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","source":"core.ac.uk","title":"Evolution of spite through indirect reciprocity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/20639020"},

However, as the result of men and women pursuing their ideal relationship types, various compromise relationships may emerge. One such compromise is explored here: the “booty call.” The results of an act-nomination and frequency study of college students provided an initial definition and exploration of this type of relationship. Booty calls tend to utilize various communication mediums to facilitate sexual contact among friends who, for men, may represent low-investment, attractive sexual partners and, for women, may represent attractive test-mates. The relationship is discussed as a compromise between men's and women's ideal mating strategies that allows men greater sexual access and women an ongoing opportunity to evaluate potential long-term mates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonason","given":"Peter K."},{"family":"Li","given":"Norman P."},{"family":"Cason","given":"Margaret J."}],"citation-key":"jonason2009","container-title":"The Journal of Sex Research","DOI":"10.1080/00224490902775827","ISSN":"0022-4499","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,24]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00224490902775827","page":"460-470","PMID":"19253133","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The “booty call”: A compromise between men's and women's ideal mating strategies","title-short":"The “booty call”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00224490902775827","volume":"46"},

Moral foundations were associated with sin through the individualizing aspects of morality. Dark personality traits accounted for almost six times more variance in individual differences in sinning than the moral foundations which suggests that it is personality rather than morality that is responsible for sinning behaviors. While sadism and spitefulness accounted for unique and significantly more variance, this was a small and specialized amount. We replicated effects suggesting men are more strongly embodied by dark personality traits and behaviors than women are, and women are more morally virtuous than men are, but showed these sex differences were a function of dark personality traits—in particular—and moral foundations.

  {"id":"jonason2018","abstract":"A useful way of understanding personality traits is to examine the motivational nature of a trait because motives drive behaviors and inﬂuence attitudes. In two cross-sectional, self-report studies (N = 942), we examined the relationships between fundamental social motives and dark personality traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, sadism, spitefulness, and Machiavellianism) and examined the role of childhood socio-ecological conditions (Study 2 only). For example, we found that Machiavellianism and psychopathy were negatively associated with motivations that involved developing and maintaining good relationships with others. Sex diﬀerences in the darker aspects of personality were a function of, at least in part, fundamental social motives such as the desire for status. Fundamental social motives mediated the associations that childhood socio-ecological conditions had with the darker aspects of personality. Our results showed how motivational tendencies in men and women may provide insights into alternative life history strategies reﬂected in dark personality traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonason","given":"Peter K."},{"family":"Zeigler-Hill","given":"Virgil"}],"citation-key":"jonason2018","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2018.05.031","ISSN":"01918869","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"language":"en","page":"98-107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The fundamental social motives that characterize dark personality traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019188691830285X","volume":"132"},

Among the features of cultural cognition that make it distinctive among conceptions of cultural theory are its approach to measuring individuals’ cultural worldviews; its empirical investigation of the social psychological mechanisms that connect individuals’ risk perceptions to their cultural worldviews; and its practical goal of enabling self-conscious management of popular risk perceptions in the interest of promoting scientifically sound public policies that are congenial to persons of diverse outlooks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahan","given":"Dan M."}],"citation-key":"kahan2012","container-title":"Handbook of Risk Theory: Epistemology, Decision Theory, Ethics, and Social Implications of Risk","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-1433-5_28","editor":[{"family":"Roeser","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Hillerbrand","given":"Rafaela"},{"family":"Sandin","given":"Per"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Martin"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-007-1433-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"725-759","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Cultural cognition as a conception of the cultural theory of risk","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1433-5_28"},

This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahneman","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tversky","given":"Amos"}],"citation-key":"kahneman1972","container-title":"Cognitive Psychology","container-title-short":"Cognitive Psychology","DOI":"10/cmf8m8","ISSN":"0010-0285","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1972,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"430-454","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness","title-short":"Subjective probability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028572900163","volume":"3"},

While researchers have constructed theories to account for the role of these variables in sexual offending, a framework that unites their study is lacking. Recently Ward, Keenan, and Hudson have proposed that sexual offenders may suffer from a deficit in their ability to understand and attribute mental states to others. Their review of the literature on the etiology of sexual offending suggested that intimacy deficits, empathy deficits, and cognitive distortions all point to a lack of awareness of other peoples' beliefs, desires, perspectives, and needs, what is commonly referred to in the developmental literature as a theory of mind. In this paper, we expand on this argument, illustrating some of the developmental pathways by which deficits in one's theory of mind can explain the pattern of deficits exhibited by many sexual offenders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Keenan","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Tony"}],"citation-key":"keenan2000","container-title":"Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment","container-title-short":"Sex Abuse","DOI":"10.1023/A:1009563821140","ISSN":"1573-286X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"49-60","source":"Springer Link","title":"A theory of mind perspective on cognitive, affective, and intimacy deficits in child sexual offenders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009563821140","volume":"12"},

Elevated power is associated with increased rewards and freedom and thereby activates approach-related tendencies. Reduced power is associated with increased threat, punishment, and social constraint and thereby activates inhibition-related tendencies. The authors derive predictions from recent theorizing about approach and inhibition and review relevant evidence. Specifically, power is associated with (a) positive affect, (b) attention to rewards, (c) automatic information processing, and (d) disinhibited behavior. In contrast, reduced power is associated with (a) negative affect; (b) attention to threat, punishment, others' interests, and those features of the self that are relevant to others' goals; (c) controlled information processing; and (d) inhibited social behavior. The potential moderators and consequences of these power-related behavioral patterns are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Keltner","given":"Dacher"},{"family":"Gruenfeld","given":"Deborah H."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Cameron"}],"citation-key":"keltner2003","container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1037/0033-295x.110.2.265","ISSN":"0033-295X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"265-284","PMID":"12747524","source":"PubMed","title":"Power, approach, and inhibition","type":"article-journal","volume":"110"},
  {"id":"keltner2010","abstract":"Although a great deal of research points to corruption and malevolent facets of power, instances of prosocial behavior have also been documented. In Chapter 6, \"Paradoxes of Power: Dynamics of the Acquisition, Experience, and Social Regulation of Social Power,\" Keltner, Gruenfeld, Galinsky, and Kraus deal with these inconsistencies, pointing out paradoxical effects of power. With respect to the acquisition of social power, they show that power is afforded to those individuals who engage socially in ways that build bonds that advance the interests of the group. With respect to the experience of power, they review evidence showing that power prioritizes the emotions, goals, and actions of high-power individuals, often leading to socially disruptive objectification of others. Finally, with respect to constraints upon power, they reveal how group-based representations (a fellow group member's reputation), communication (gossip), and self-assessments (an individual's modest sense of power) constrain the actions of those in power according to how they advance group interests.

We assessed how the sexual relationship power described by men living with HIV (MLWH) associates with periconception HIV-transmission risk behavior. Quantitative surveys were conducted with 82 MLWH reporting a recent pregnancy with an HIV-negative or unknown-serostatus partner in KwaZuluNatal, South Africa. Surveys assessed decision-making dominance (DMD) using the Pulerwitz et al. sexual relationship power scale; partnership characteristics; and HIV-risk behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated associations between DMD score and HIV-risk behaviors. Higher male decision-making dominance was associated with non-disclosure of HIV-serostatus to pregnancy partner (aRR 2.00, 95% CI 1.52, 2.64), not knowing partner’s HIV-serostatus (aRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.27, 2.13), condomless sex since pregnancy (aRR 1.92, 95% CI 1.08, 3.43), and concurrent relationships (aRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.20, 1.88).

  {"id":"kim2020","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Attachment theory provides a powerful framework for understanding individual differences affecting interpersonal relationships and a range of health behavior outcomes. However, no meta-analyses have yet to examine the relationship between adult attachment styles and risky sexual behaviors. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the results of the association between adult attachment and risky sexual behaviors.\nMETHOD: Keywords were searched via PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We used comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) 3.0 to systematically synthesize and analyze the 42 effect sizes from 16 studies (total N = 7,233).\nRESULTS: Attachment anxiety has a small effect on having multiple partners (Fisher's Z = .09, 95% CI [0.021, 0.154]; I² = 80.4%) and engaging in condomless sex (Fisher's Z = .09, 95% CI [.006, 0.175]; I² = 82.5%), whereas attachment avoidance has a small effect on having multiple partners (Fisher's Z = .06, 95% CI [0.019, 0.109]; I² = 57.6%) but no effect on engaging in condomless sex (Fisher's Z = .05, 95% CI [-0.024, 0.117]; I2 = 73.9%). Furthermore, average age of participants in a study (z = 3.31, β = .01, p = .001) and type of risk population (z = 3.03, β = .12, p = .002) were found to be significant moderators.\nCONCLUSIONS: Insecure attachment styles are related to risky sexual behaviors and the correlation between attachment anxiety and having multiple partners is stronger as the average age of participant increases and when the study population is specifically an at-risk population.

  {"id":"kimbrough2012","abstract":"Spiteful, antisocial behavior may undermine the moral and institutional fabric of society, producing disorder, fear, and mistrust. Previous research demonstrates the willingness of individuals to harm others, but little is understood about how far people are willing to go in being spiteful (relative to how far they could have gone) or their consistency in spitefulness across repeated trials. Our experiment is the first to provide individuals with repeated opportunities to spitefully harm anonymous others when the decision entails zero cost to the spiter and cannot be observed as such by the object of spite. This method reveals that the majority of individuals exhibit consistent (non-)spitefulness over time and that the distribution of spitefulness is bipolar: when choosing whether to be spiteful, most individuals either avoid spite altogether or impose the maximum possible harm on their unwitting victims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kimbrough","given":"Erik O."},{"family":"Reiss","given":"J.

However, the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, sadism, and spitefulness) and PIU has yet to be investigated. Consequently, the objectives of this study were to investigate the relationships of dark traits with speciﬁc online activities (i.e., social media, gaming, gambling, shopping, and sex) and PIU. Methods: A total of 772 university students completed a self-report survey, including the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen Scale, Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, Spitefulness Scale, and an adapted version of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results: Hierarchical regression analysis and a multiple mediation model indicated that being male was positively associated with higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling, and negatively associated with social media and online shopping. Narcissism was related to higher social media use; Machiavellianism was related to higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling; sadism was related to online sex; and spitefulness was associated with online sex, online gambling, and online shopping. Finally, Machiavellianism and spitefulness were directly and indirectly associated with PIU via online gambling, online gaming, and online shopping, and narcissism was indirectly associated with PIU through social media use. Discussion: Findings of this preliminary study show that individuals high in dark personality traits may be more vulnerable in developing problematic online use and that further research is warranted to examine the associations of dark personality traits with speciﬁc types of problematic online activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kircaburun","given":"Kagan"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Mark D."}],"citation-key":"kircaburun2018","container-title":"Journal of Behavioral Addictions","container-title-short":"Journal of Behavioral Addictions","DOI":"10.1556/2006.7.2018.109","ISSN":"2062-5871, 2063-5303","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"993-1003","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The dark side of internet: preliminary evidence for the associations of dark personality traits with specific online activities and problematic internet use","title-short":"The dark side of internet","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.akademiai.com/doi/10.1556/2006.7.2018.109","volume":"7"},

Yet a decade of research suggests that, like humans, other animals can differentiate between what they know and what they do not know. They opt out of difficult trials; they avoid tests they are unlikely to answer correctly; and they make riskier “bets” when their memories are accurate than they do when their memories are inaccurate. These feats are simultaneously impressive and, by human standards, somewhat limited; new evidence suggests, however, that animals can generalize metacognitive judgments to new contexts and seek more information when they are unsure.

The findings support published assertions of high rates of rape and other forms of sexual aggression among large normal populations.

In eight experiments, we examined the link between immorality and self-dehumanization, testing both (a) the causal role of immoral behavior on self-dehumanization and (b) the causal role of self-dehumanization on immoral behavior. Studies 1a to 1d showed that people feel less human after behaving immorally and that these effects were not driven by having a negative experience but were unique to experiences of immorality (Study 1d). Studies 2a to 2c showed that self-dehumanization can lead to immoral and antisocial behavior. Study 3 highlighted how self-dehumanization can sometimes produce downward spirals of immorality, demonstrating initial unethical behavior leading to self-dehumanization, which in turn promotes continued dishonesty.

Here, I show that the distinctions among them arise from the ways in which fitness is partitioned: none can be drawn when the fitness consequences of an action are wholly aggregated, but they manifest clearly when the consequences are partitioned into primary and secondary (neighbourhood) effects. I argue that the primary interaction is the principal source of adaptive design, because (i) it is this interaction that determines the fit of an adaptation and (ii) it is the actor and primary recipients whom an adaptation foremost affects. The categories of social action are thus instrumental to any account of evolved function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Krupp","given":"D.

A position of power entails making difficult decisions for other people that may cause pain and suffering. Dehumanization helps to downplay this pain and suffering and thus to justify these decisions. Study 1 shows that powerful people dehumanize an outgroup more. Study 2 replicates that powerful people dehumanize an outgroup more and shows that this is especially likely after making a tough decision that is painful for that outgroup. Study 3 replicates this in a medical context. Together, these studies show that dehumanization—although by itself a very negative phenomenon—can also have functional elements: it helps powerful people to make tough decisions in a more distant, cold, and rational manner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Lammers","given":"Joris"},{"family":"Stapel","given":"Diederik A."}],"citation-key":"lammers2011","container-title":"Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","container-title-short":"Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","DOI":"10.1177/1368430210370042","ISSN":"1368-4302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"113-126","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Power increases dehumanization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430210370042","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"landy2015","abstract":"The role of emotion in moral judgment is currently a topic of much debate in moral psychology. One specific claim made by many researchers is that irrelevant feelings of disgust can amplify the severity of moral condemnation. Numerous researchers have found this effect, but there have also been several published failures to replicate it. Clarifying this issue would inform important theoretical debates among rival accounts of moral judgment. We meta-analyzed all available studies—published and unpublished—in which incidental disgust was manipulated prior to or concurrent with a moral judgment task (k = 50). We found evidence for a small amplification effect of disgust (d = 0.11), which is strongest for gustatory/olfactory modes of disgust induction. However, there is also some suggestion of publication bias in this literature, and when this is accounted for, the effect disappears entirely (d = −0.01). Moreover, prevalent confounds mean that the effect size that we estimate is best interpreted as an upper bound on the size of the amplification effect. On the basis of the results of this meta-analysis, we argue against strong claims about the causal role of affect in moral judgment and suggest a need for new, more rigorous research on this topic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Landy","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Geoffrey P."}],"citation-key":"landy2015","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691615583128","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"518-536","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Does incidental disgust amplify moral judgment?

  {"id":"laustsen2020","abstract":"Research shows that conservative and right-wing individuals are more likely than liberal and left-wing individuals to prefer dominant leaders. According to adaptive followership theory, this reflects psychological mechanisms that tag dominant individuals as more competent under situations of conflict. Conservatives tend to view the world as dangerous and ridden with intergroup conflict and, hence, have heightened preferences for dominant leaders (the competence explanation). Yet, an alternative mechanism is possible, where people stereotypically associate dominant-looking leaders with conservativism such that conservatives perceive these leaders as more similar to themselves (the similarity explanation). Hence, the effects of dominance might not be a matter of perceived competence but of perceived policy agreement. This article pits these explanations about the underlying psychological mechanisms against each other. Using nationally representative survey experiments, we find support for the competence explanation by demonstrating that right-wing individuals prefer dominant candidates even if they are clearly politically closer to non-dominant candidates. This preference for dominant candidates only fades when the dominant candidates are from entirely different political parties than the right-wing individuals themselves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Laustsen","given":"Lasse"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"}],"citation-key":"laustsen2020","collection-title":"Special issue on Evolution and Biology of Leadership","container-title":"The Leadership Quarterly","container-title-short":"The Leadership Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.leaqua.2019.06.002","ISSN":"1048-9843","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101301","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Why are right-wing voters attracted to dominant leaders?

We first consider the historic role of Sigmund Freud and note that a broad scientific interest in deviant sexual behavior was well established by 1900. In the early to mid-20th century, two psychologies were prominent in the development of behavioral approaches, those of John B. Watson and Alfred Kinsey. Behavior therapy for a variety of problems emerged in the 1950s and soon found application to deviant sexuality. The development of penile plethysmography helped to focus interest on deviant sexual preference and behavior. While nonbehavioral approaches to sexual offenders paralleled these developments, a combination of behavioral and cognitive behavioral treatments began to emerge in the late 1960s which ultimately developed into the approaches more commonly seen today.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Laws","given":"D.

We found stronger effects of admiration on risk attitude and income than of rivalry and no evidence that risk attitude and narcissism share variance when predicting income. Contrary to previous studies, we found that an individual's income was independent of their risk attitude.

Preschool children's judgments of intentional action show a valence-driven asymmetry. Children say that a foreseen but disavowed side effect is brought about “on purpose” when the side effect itself is morally bad, but not when it is morally good. This is the first demonstration in preschoolers that moral judgment influences judgments of whether something was done on purpose (as opposed to judgments of purpose influencing moral judgment). Judgments of intentionality are usually assumed to be purely factual. That these judgments are sometimes partly normative—even in preschoolers—challenges current understanding. Young children's judgments regarding foreseen side effects depend on whether the children process the idea that the character does not care about the side effect.

Evolution has often confronted such dilemmas—e.g., in bacterial biofilms—in the challenges of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups; there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions that maintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon,” and hence in how groups of individuals form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Simon A."}],"citation-key":"levin2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1400830111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"Supplement 3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,22]]},"language":"en","page":"10838-10845","PMID":"25024192","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Public goods in relation to competition, cooperation, and spite","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_3/10838","volume":"111"},

This distribution is then used with a reasonable degree of success to explain the results of the earlier rounds of centipede and the results of some public goods contribution games.

  {"id":"lewis2002","abstract":"The dominance concept as it is currently defined and applied in animal behavior is problematic. What has been traditionally considered dominance is actually a combination of dominance in the strict sense and power based upon other sources. Rather than working within the current paradigm, I propose a conceptual revision founded upon the more inclusive concept of power. Power is a phenomenon where a dyadic relationship is asymmetrical (Simon 1953) and can be divided into two types: dominance and leverage. Dominance is power based upon the ability to use force. Leverage is power based upon a resource that cannot be taken by force. Four characteristics of power are used in sociology (base, means, amount, and scope) that facilitate both the expansion of the power concept beyond traditional dominance and the application of these theoretical ideas in empirical studies. This cross‐disciplinary approach to power allows a wide range of behaviors to be considered as critical while at the same time it focuses the attention of researchers to the aspects of power that differ among dyads, classes, and species. Power is not simply a linear combination of dominance and leverage, and more research is needed before the exact nature of this relationship can be clarified.

  {"id":"locey2011","abstract":"Laboratory studies of choice and decision making among real monetary rewards typically use smaller real rewards than those common in real life. When laboratory rewards are large, they are almost always hypothetical. In applying laboratory results meaningfully to real-life situations, it is important to know the extent to which choices among hypothetical rewards correspond to choices among real rewards and whether variation of the magnitude of hypothetical rewards affects behavior in meaningful ways. The present study compared real and hypothetical monetary rewards in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants played a temporal discounting game that incorporates the logic of a repeated prisoner’s-dilemma (PD) type game versus tit-for-tat; choice of one alternative (“defection” in PD terminology) resulted in a small-immediate reward; choice of the other alternative (“cooperation” in PD terminology) resulted in a larger reward delayed until the following trial. The larger-delayed reward was greater for half of the groups than for the other half. Rewards also differed in type across groups: multiples of real nickels, hypothetical nickels or hypothetical hundred-dollar bills. All groups significantly increased choice of the larger delayed reward over the 40 trials of the experiment. Over the last 10 trials, cooperation was significantly higher when the difference between larger and smaller hypothetical rewards was greater. Reward type (real or hypothetical) made no significant difference in cooperation. In Experiment 2, real and hypothetical rewards were compared in social discounting – the decrease in value to the giver of a reward as social distance increases to the receiver of the reward. Social discount rates were well described by a hyperbolic function. Discounting rates for real and hypothetical rewards did not significantly differ. These results add to the evidence that results of experiments with hypothetical rewards validly apply in everyday life.","author":[{"family":"Locey","given":"Matthew"},{"literal":"Bryan Jones"},{"family":"Rachlin","given":"Howard"}],"citation-key":"locey2011","container-title":"Judgement and Decision-Making","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"552-564","title":"Real and hypothetical rewards","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"lonsway1994","abstract":"Theories of sexual aggression and victimization have increasingly emphasized the role of rape myths in the perpetuation of sexual assault. Rape myths are attitudes and generally false beliefs about rape that are widely and persistently held, and that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression against women. Acceptance of such myths has been assessed with a number of measures, and investigators have examined its relationship with numerous variables and interventions. Although there has been extensive research in this area, definitions, terminology, and measures of rape myth acceptance (RMA) continue to lack adequate theoretical and psychometric precision. Despite such criticisms, we emphasize that the significance of this type of research cannot be overstated because it has immense potential for the understanding of sexual assault. The present article offers a theory-based definition of rape myths, reviews and critiques the literature on rape myth acceptance, and suggests directions for future research. In particular we argue that such work must include the development and application of improved measures, with more concern for the theoretical and methodological issues unique to this field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Lonsway","given":"Kimberly A."},{"family":"Fitzgerald","given":"Louise F."}],"citation-key":"lonsway1994","container-title":"Psychology of Women Quarterly","DOI":"10.1111/j.1471-6402.1994.tb00448.x","ISSN":"1471-6402","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1994.tb00448.x","page":"133-164","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"RAPE MYTHS. in review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1994.tb00448.x","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"maes2019","abstract":"Introduction\nThe current study addresses how sexualizing online media practices, i.e., exposure to sexually explicit internet material and receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, relate to the acceptance of sexist attitudes among adolescents. Specifically, it extends previous research on the acceptance of rape myths by exploring a construct related to these beliefs, i.e., resistance towards the metoo-movement.\nMethods\nThe study is based on a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey among 568 Flemish adolescents (15–18 years old, Mage = 16.4, SD = .98, 58.3% girls) that measured adolescents’ sexualizing online media use, sexist attitudes and objectification processes.\nResults\nThe results showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material, but not receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, was related to more resistance towards the metoo-movement and the acceptance of rape myths through notions of women as sex objects. Self-objectification did not function as a valid mediator in the examined relations. Gender and self-esteem did not moderate the proposed relations.\nConclusions\nThe findings underline the role of media use in how adolescents develop sexist beliefs and, more precisely, beliefs about contemporary actions to combat sexism, i.e., the metoo-movement. The present study showed that sexual objectification fueled by sexually explicit internet material may result in less positive attitudes and, thus, more resistance towards this movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Maes","given":"Chelly"},{"family":"Schreurs","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Oosten","given":"Johanna M.

Researchers have been divided into two groups - those who study leaders and those who study publics.

More recently, theory and research have attempted to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory roles by integrating them. Emotion's role in politics is pervasive both because emotion enables past experience to be encoded with its evaluative history and because emotion enables contemporary circumstances to be quickly evaluated.

  {"id":"marcus2014","abstract":"Spite is an understudied construct that has been virtually ignored within the personality, social, and clinical psychology literatures. This study introduces a self-report Spitefulness Scale to assess individual differences in spitefulness. The scale was initially tested on a large sample of 946 college students and cross-validated on a national sample of 297 adults. The scale was internally consistent in both samples. Factor analysis supported a 1-factor solution for the initial pool of 31 items. Item response theory analysis was used to identify the best performing of the original 31 items in the university sample and reduce the scale to 17 items. Tests of measurement invariance indicated that the items functioned similarly across both university and national samples, across both men and women, and across both ethnic majority and minority groups. Men reported higher levels of spitefulness than women, younger people were more spiteful than older people, and ethnic minority members reported higher levels of spitefulness than ethnic majority members. Across both samples, spitefulness was positively associated with aggression, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and guilt-free shame, and negatively correlated with selfesteem, guilt-proneness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Ideally, this Spitefulness Scale will be able to predict behavior in both laboratory settings (e.g., ultimatum games, aggression paradigms) and everyday life, contribute to the diagnosis of personality disorders and oppositional defiant disorder, and encourage further study of this neglected, often destructive, trait.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Marcus","given":"David K."},{"family":"Zeigler-Hill","given":"Virgil"},{"family":"Mercer","given":"Sterett H."},{"family":"Norris","given":"Alyssa L."}],"citation-key":"marcus2014","container-title":"Psychological Assessment","container-title-short":"Psychological Assessment","DOI":"10.1037/a0036039","ISSN":"1939-134X, 1040-3590","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"563-574","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The psychology of spite and the measurement of spitefulness.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0036039","volume":"26"},

The first personality scale designed to assess trait spitefulness was only developed recently (Marcus, Zeigler-Hill, Mercer, & Norris, 2014). There is also no standard definition of spitefulness. Spite can be broadly defined to include any vindictive or mean-spirited actions. Alternatively, a narrower definition includes the requirement that spiteful acts involve some degree of self-harm (e.g., “cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face”). The current chapter focuses on this narrow definition, both because it distinguishes spite from other related acts of aggression and because it emphasizes the apparently irrational and paradoxical nature of spitefulness.

We might assume people everywhere would be more willing to punish someone who hurt them directly (2PP) than someone who hurt an anonymous third person (3PP). While this is true of small societies, people in large societies are actually more likely to engage in 3PP than 2PP. Strong reciprocity, including generous offers and 3PP, exists mostly in large, complex societies that face numerous challenging collective action problems.

  {"id":"martini2021","abstract":"The study aimed to validate the Italian version of the Measure for Assessing Subtle Rape Myths developed by McMahon and Farmer. A sample of 3,915 university students (70.8% female) completed the questionnaire. After an exploratory factor analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis tested the resulting four-factor structure of the Italian Subtle Rape Myth Acceptance (SRMA-IT) Scale (“She Asked for It”; “He Didn’t Mean To”; “It Wasn’t Really Rape”; and “She Lied”), consistent with McMahon and Farmer’s initial hypothesis. The Italian validation did not include items related to intoxication. Internal consistency of the subscales was good (α from .78 to .90). Convergent validity between all subscales and System Justification–Gender was detected: A strong relationship was observed (r is from .19 to .33; p < .001). The independent-sample T test then showed that women accepted all four rape myths significantly less than men: Effect size is more than moderate for the myth “She Asked for It” (Cohen’s d = .60) and between small and moderate for the other myths (d is from .35 to .42). Acceptance of rape myths is often associated with higher men’s proclivity to rape and with tendency to raped women’s double victimization (they can be not believed or blamed when they disclose the rape). Having a validated instrument to measure rape myth acceptance can enhance empirical research on this topic and help to develop interventions of prevention both for men in the society and for the first responders to disclosures, also sustaining a culture of respect and of contrast to violence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Martini","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Tartaglia","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"De Piccoli","given":"Norma"}],"citation-key":"martini2021","container-title":"Sexual Abuse","container-title-short":"Sex Abuse","DOI":"10.1177/10790632211028158","ISSN":"1079-0632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"language":"en","page":"10790632211028158","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc; https://web.archive.org/web/20211207133037/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10790632211028158","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Assessing rape myth acceptance: A contribution to italian validation of the measure for assessing subtle rape myth (SRMA-IT)","title-short":"Assessing rape myth acceptance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/10790632211028158"},

Our experiment induces a negative emotion, worry, during a perceptual task. In a numerosity task subjects have to make a two alternative forced choice and then reveal their confidence in this decision. We measure metacognition in terms of discrimination and calibration abilities. Our results show that metacognition, but not choice, is affected by the level of worry anticipated before the decision. Under worry individuals tend to have better metacognition in terms of the two measures.

  {"id":"mcauliffe2019","abstract":"The past few decades of moral psychology research have yielded empirical anomalies for rationalist theories of moral judgments. An increasing number of psychologists and philosophers argue that these anomalies are explained well by sentimentalism, the thesis that the presence of an emotion is necessary for the formation of a sincere moral judgment. The present review reveals that while emotions and moral judgments indeed often co-occur, there is scant evidence that emotions directly cause or constitute moral judgments. Research on disgust, anger, sympathy, and guilt indicates that people only reliably experience emotions when judging conduct that is relevant to the welfare of the self and valued others. Moreover, many recent studies have either failed to replicate or exposed crucial confounds in the most cited evidence in support of sentimentalism. Moral psychologists should jettison sentimentalism, and focus instead on how considerations of harm and welfare—the core concepts of rationalist theories— interact with empirical beliefs to shape moral judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McAuliffe","given":"William H.

Previous research suggests that deontological moral judgments are often underpinned by affective reactions and utilitarian moral judgments by deliberative thinking. Separately, research on the psychology of aging has shown that affect plays a more prominent role in the judgments and decision making of older (vs. younger) adults. Yet age remains a largely overlooked factor in moral judgment research. Here, we therefore investigated whether older adults would make more deontological judgments on the basis of experiencing different affective reactions to moral dilemmas as compared with younger adults. Results from 2 experiments indicated that older adults made significantly more deontological moral judgments. Mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between age and making more deontological moral judgments is partly explained by older adults exhibiting significantly more negative affective reactions and having more morally idealistic beliefs as compared with younger adults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McNair","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Okan","given":"Yasmina"},{"family":"Hadjichristidis","given":"Constantinos"},{"family":"Bruin","given":"Wändi Bruine","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"mcnair2019","container-title":"Journal of Behavioral Decision Making","container-title-short":"J Behav Dec Making","DOI":"10.1002/bdm.2086","ISSN":"08943257","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","page":"47-60","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Age differences in moral judgment: older adults are more deontological than younger adults","title-short":"Age differences in moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/bdm.2086","volume":"32"},

In the 1980s and ’90s, the field shifted as researchers increasingly used sociocultural theories, particularly the work of L. S. Vygotsky, to frame investigations of literacy. This article provides a brief review of schema theory as situated in literacy studies. The authors review various conceptions of schema theory to consider how recent social and cultural perspectives might prompt reconsideration of schemas as transactional and embodied constructs. Concomitantly, they explore how earlier conceptions of schema theory may assist researchers in their articulation of concepts such as ideal and material tools and the role of activity in Vygotsky’s work.

It was independent of social desirability (correlated .08 with the Crowne and Marlowe social desirability scale).

  {"id":"mercer2013","abstract":"<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Sexual behaviour and relationships are key components of wellbeing and are affected by social norms, attitudes, and health. We present data on sexual behaviours and attitudes in Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) from the three National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal).</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We used a multistage, clustered, and stratified probability sample design. Within each of the 1727 sampled postcode sectors for Natsal-3, 30 or 36 addresses were randomly selected and then assigned to interviewers. To oversample individuals aged 16–34 years, we randomly allocated addresses to either the core sample (in which individuals aged 16–74 years were eligible) or the boost sample (in which only individuals aged 16–34 years were eligible). Interviewers visited all sampled addresses between Sept 6, 2010, and Aug 31, 2012, and randomly selected one eligible individual from each household to be invited to participate. Participants completed the survey in their own homes through computer-assisted face-to-face interviews and self-interview. We analysed data from this survey, weighted to account for unequal selection probabilities and non-response to correct for differences in sex, age group, and region according to 2011 Census figures. We then compared data from participants aged 16–44 years from Natsal-1 (1990–91), Natsal-2 (1999–2001), and Natsal-3.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Interviews were completed with 15 162 participants (6293 men, 8869 women) from 26 274 eligible addresses (57·7%). 82·1% (95% CI 81·0–83·1%) of men and 77·7% (76·7–78·7%) of women reported at least one sexual partner of the opposite sex in the past year. The proportion generally decreased with age, as did the range of sexual practices with partners of the opposite sex, especially in women. The increased sexual activity and diversity reported in Natsal-2 in individuals aged 16–44 years when compared with Natsal-1 has generally been sustained in Natsal-3, but in men has generally not risen further. However, in women, the number of male sexual partners over the lifetime (age-adjusted odds ratio 1·18, 95% CI 1·08–1·28), proportion reporting ever having had a sexual experience with genital contact with another woman (1·69, 1·43–2·00), and proportion reporting at least one female sexual partner in the past 5 years (2·00, 1·59–2·51) increased in Natsal-3 compared with Natsal-2. While reported number of occasions of heterosexual intercourse in the past 4 weeks had reduced since Natsal-2, we recorded an expansion of heterosexual repertoires—particularly in oral and anal sex—over time. Acceptance of same-sex partnerships and intolerance of non-exclusivity in marriage increased in men and women in Natsal-3.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Sexual lifestyles in Britain have changed substantially in the past 60 years, with changes in behaviour seeming greater in women than men. The continuation of sexual activity into later life—albeit reduced in range and frequency—emphasises that attention to sexual health and wellbeing is needed throughout the life course.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Grants from the UK Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, with support from the Economic and Social Research Council and the Department of Health.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Mercer","given":"Catherine H."},{"family":"Tanton","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Prah","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Erens","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Sonnenberg","given":"Pam"},{"family":"Clifton","given":"Soazig"},{"family":"Macdowall","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Field","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Datta","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Copas","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Phelps","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Wellings","given":"Kaye"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Anne M."}],"citation-key":"mercer2013","container-title":"The Lancet","container-title-short":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62035-8","ISSN":"0140-6736, 1474-547X","issue":"9907","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,30]]},"language":"English","page":"1781-1794","PMID":"24286784","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"www.thelancet.com","title":"Changes in sexual attitudes and lifestyles in britain through the life course and over time: findings from the national surveys of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (natsal)","title-short":"Changes in sexual attitudes and lifestyles in britain through the life course and over time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62035-8/abstract","volume":"382"},

We demonstrate that similar judgments arise when people consider damage to owned objects. In two experiments, participants considered dilemmas where saving five inanimate objects required destroying one. Participants judged this unacceptable when it required violating another’s ownership rights, but not otherwise. They also judged that sacrificing another’s object was less acceptable as a means than as a side-effect; judgments did not depend on whether property damage involved personal force. These findings inform theories of moral decision-making. They show that utilitarian judgment can be decreased without physical harm to persons, and without personal force.

Based on self-affirmation theory, we predicted that providing an opportunity to self-affirm decreases the tendency to morally condemn harmless sexual taboos. In Experiment 1, we found evidence that self-affirmation decreases the moral condemnation of harmless sexual taboos and ruled out that this was due to a decrease in how disgusting participants considered taboo acts. In Experiment 2, we replicated this effect and demonstrated the mediating role of self-directed threat emotions. These results demonstrate that the tendency to morally condemn harmless sexual taboos arises in part from the need to protect self-integrity.

  {"id":"moore2007","abstract":"Since HIV in Africa is spread primarily through unprotected sex, safe sex practices such as condom use can reduce HIV spread significantly. Nevertheless, because sexual behavior involves complex dynamics, condom use is not an easy option for many people in Africa despite years of condom distribution intervention. In fact, the complex nature of sexuality complicates efforts to combat HIV spread and limits the effectiveness of many prevention efforts. This paper uses theoretical explanations—social representation theory, situated rationality theory, and social action theory—to examine the patterns of sexual risk behavior and the underlying reasons and rationalization among people living with HIV/AIDS in Lomé, Togo. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 151 people living with HIV/AIDS, recruited from 3 HIV/AIDS centers. The results of this in-depth study suggest that although people living with HIV/AIDS may be aware of the risk of infecting their sexual partners, they deliberately ignore the risk because other considerations, such as wanting a baby, take precedence. Consequently, condom access is inadequate to change risky sexual behavior that spreads HIV. It must be supplemented with adequate empowerment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Ami R."},{"family":"Oppong","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"moore2007","collection-title":"HIV/AIDS, gender, agency and empowerment issues in Africa","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.10.004","ISSN":"0277-9536","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1057-1066","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Sexual risk behavior among people living with HIV/AIDS in togo","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953606005156","volume":"64"},

Abstract Humans and other animals constantly evaluate their decisions in order to learn and behave adaptively. Experimentally, such evaluation processes are accessed using metacognitive reports made after decisions, typically using verbally formulated confidence scales. When subjects report high confidence, it reflects a high certainty of being correct, but a low confidence might signify either low certainty about the outcome, or a high certainty of being incorrect. Hence, metacognitive reports might reflect not only different levels of decision certainty, but also two certainty directions (certainty of being correct and certainty of being incorrect). It is important to test if such bi-directional processing can be measured because, for decision-making under uncertainty, information about being incorrect is as important as information about being correct for guidance of subsequent behavior. We were able to capture implicit bi-directional certainty readouts by asking subjects to bet money on their perceptual decision accuracy using a six-grade wager scale (post-decision wagering, PDW). To isolate trial-specific aspects of metacognitive judgments, we used pre-decision wagering (wagering before the perceptual decision) to subtract, from PDW trials, influences resulting from non-trial-specific assessment of expected difficulty and psychological biases. This novel design allowed independent quantification of certainty of being correct and certainty of being incorrect, showing that subjects were able to read out certainty in a bi-directional manner. Certainty readouts about being incorrect were particularly associated with metacognitive sensitivity exceeding perceptual sensitivity (i.e. meta-d' > d'), suggesting that such enhanced metacognitive efficiency is driven by information about incorrect decisions. Readouts of certainty in both directions increased on easier trials, and both certainty directions were also associated with faster metacognitive reaction times, indicating that certainty of being incorrect was not confounded with low certainty. Finally, both readouts influenced the amount of money subjects earned through PDW, suggesting that bi-directional readouts are important for planning future actions when feedback about previous decisions is unavailable.

Indeed, in second-price auctions it is optimal to bid above one's valuation; that is, bidding \"frenzies\" can arise in equilibrium. Further, revenue equivalence between second-price and first-price auctions breaks down, with second-price outperforming first-price. We also find that strategic equivalence between second-price and English auctions no longer holds, although they remain revenue equivalent.

  {"id":"nadarevic2021","abstract":"Due to the information overload in today’s digital age, people may sometimes feel pressured to process and judge information especially fast. In three experiments, we examined whether time pressure increases the repetition-based truth effect—the tendency to judge repeatedly encountered statements more likely as “true” than novel statements. Based on the Heuristic-Systematic Model, a dual-process model in the field of persuasion research, we derived the following predictions. We expected that time pressure would boost the truth effect by increasing reliance on processing fluency as a presumably heuristic cue for truth, and by decreasing knowledge retrieval as a presumably slow and systematic process that determines truth judgments. However, unlike predicted, time pressure did not moderate the truth effect. Importantly, this was the case for difficult statements, for which most people lack prior knowledge, as well as for easy statements, for which most people hold relevant knowledge. Overall, the findings clearly speak against the conception of fast, fluency-based truth judgments versus slow, knowledge-based truth judgments. In contrast, the results are compatible with the referential theory of the truth effect that does not distinguish between different types of truth judgments. Instead, it assumes that truth judgments rely on the coherence of localized networks in people’s semantic memory, formed by both: repetition and prior knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Nadarevic","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Schnuerch","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Stegemann","given":"Marlena J."}],"citation-key":"nadarevic2021","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/53vgc","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,11]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Judging fast and slow: the truth effect does not increase under time-pressure conditions","title-short":"Judging fast and slow","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/53vgc"},

Recent studies hypothesize that the human mind also contains mechanisms for spontaneously coordinating conflict behavior on the basis of difference in physical strength, even if strength is not rationally relevant to the conflict. We provide the first direct, experimental test of the existence of such mechanisms. We do so by applying a non-physical, anonymous, economic game - the war of attrition - in which male contestants compete by means of perseverance to win a monetary prize. While initial studies provided some support for the prediction, the final well-powered and pre-registered study failed to support the prediction. Overall, we interpret our findings as evidence against the hypothesis that the human mind attributes relevance to physical factors that are irrelevant for the actual resolution of a conflict. We discuss implications for existing findings in the field and provide directions for further research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Nafziger","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Alexander Karl"}],"citation-key":"nguyen2021","container-title":"Evolution and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Evolution and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2020.06.003","ISSN":"1090-5138","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"21-29","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Do physically stronger males prevail in non-physical conflicts?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513820300726","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"nichols2002","abstract":"There is a large tradition of work in moral psychology that explores the capacity for moral judgment by focusing on the basic capacity to distinguish moral violations (e.g. hitting another person) from conventional violations (e.g. playing with your food). However, only recently have there been attempts to characterize the cognitive mechanisms underlying moral judgment (e.g. Cognition 57 (1995) 1; Ethics 103 (1993) 337). Recent evidence indicates that affect plays a crucial role in mediating the capacity to draw the moral/conventional distinction. However, the prevailing account of the role of affect in moral judgment is problematic. This paper argues that the capacity to draw the moral/conventional distinction depends on both a body of information about which actions are prohibited (a Normative Theory) and an affective mechanism. This account leads to the prediction that other normative prohibitions that are connected to an affective mechanism might be treated as non-conventional. An experiment is presented that indicates that “disgust” violations (e.g. spitting at the table), are distinguished from conventional violations along the same dimensions as moral violations. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"nucci2017","abstract":"Prior research has outlined developmental changes within the conventional and personal domains. Research thus far has provided only limited understanding of agerelated changes within the moral domain. That research indicates that there are continuities and discontinuities across ages in moral judgments. The aims of the research presented here were to examine moral judgments in childhood and adolescence, taking into account applications of moral judgments in contexts and the coordination of different considerations in evaluations and decisions. Participants were 167 children and adolescents drawn from two regions of the United States, from diverse ethnic and SES backgrounds, distributed across four age groups from 8 to 17 years. Moral judgments were assessed through interviews around issues of direct harm (hitting), indirect harm (returning dropped money), and helping. Each situation was presented within three conditions: unconflicted situations; situations of conflict with needs of self; and conflicts with needs of another. Situations varied in terms of characteristics of the person who was the object of moral decisions: a generic other, vulnerable other, or antagonistic other. Participants made two types of judgments: whether the action was right or wrong; and whether the actor would have a right to engage in the action if that was the actor’s choice. Justifications were elicited for judgments. Cross-age continuities in moral judgments were observed in judgments of acts as wrong in the unconflicted contexts. In contrast, a U-shaped age-related pattern was revealed in judgments of acts as well as the right to engage in acts in the conflicted situations with 8- and 16-year-olds judging acts as wrong and 10- to 14-year-olds more likely to judge acts as right and the actor as having a right to engage in the action. This U-shaped pattern was accompanied by three age-related levels in the coordination of moral and nonmoral elements of situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Nucci","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Turiel","given":"Elliot"},{"family":"Roded","given":"Alona D."}],"citation-key":"nucci2017","container-title":"Human Development","container-title-short":"Human Development","DOI":"10.1159/000484067","ISSN":"0018-716X, 1423-0054","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"279-341","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Continuities and discontinuities in the development of moral judgments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/484067","volume":"60"},

Political decisions are not only binding for the citizens concerned. First of all, mutual bindingness has to be achieved between the political agents involved. This paper aims to present a process-oriented analysis of the normative forces at work in political face-to-face decision interactions. In this context, we introduce a two-dimensional conception of political normativity. The dimension of implicit, in-process normativity complements the dimension of explicit, rule-following normativity. The second part of the paper provides an empirical illustration of a typical political practice of decision-making, taken from an analysis of actual committee meetings.

Researchers have distinguished between grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism and suggested that grandiose narcissism may predict aggression. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between vulnerable narcissism and aggression in sample groups of Japanese undergraduate students. In Study 1, vulnerable narcissism predicted anger and hostility but did not predict physical and verbal aggression, after controlling for grandiose narcissism and self-esteem. In Study 2, when individuals with higher levels of vulnerable narcissism recalled their own experience of social rejection, they gave more aggressive evaluations of the person who provoked them. These results suggest that vulnerable narcissism could increase specific facets of aggression and increase aggression in specific situations.

Principal components analysis in Study 1 (n = 206) revealed three factors of Pathogen, Sexual, and Moral Disgust that demonstrated excellent reliability, including test–retest over 12 weeks. Confirmatory factor analyses in Study 2 (n = 406) supported the three factors. Supportive evidence for the validity of the Pathogen and Sexual Disgust subscales was found in Study 1 and Study 2 with strong associations with disgust/contamination and weak associations with negative affect. However, the validity of the Moral Disgust subscale was limited. Study 3 (n = 200) showed that the TDDS subscales differentially related to personality traits. Study 4 (n = 47) provided evidence for the validity of the TDDS subscales in relation to multiple indices of disgust/contamination aversion in a select sample. Study 5 (n = 70) further highlighted limitations of the Moral Disgust subscale given the lack of a theoretically consistent association with moral attitudes. Lastly, Study 6 (n = 178) showed that responses on the Moral Disgust scale were more intense when anger was the response option compared with when disgust was the response option.

  {"id":"osorio2015","abstract":"Objectives This study intends to evaluate whether the belief that condoms are 100% effective in protecting against HIV infection is associated with sexual risk behaviours among youth.\nMethods A cross-sectional study was performed in representative samples of high-school students in the Philippines, El Salvador and Peru. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. Students were asked about the risk of HIV transmission if one has sex using condoms. They were also asked to indicate whether they had ever had sexual relations and whether they used a condom in their first sexual relation. The sample was composed of 8994 students, aged 13–18.\nResults One out of seven adolescents believed condoms are 100% effective (safe-sex believers). Those adolescents were 82% more likely to have had sex than those without such belief, after adjusting for confounders (OR=1.82; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.21). On the contrary, no association was found between risk perception and condom use. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses produced similar results.\nConclusions This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study conducted specifically to evaluate this phenomenon and that has used the same questionnaire and the same data collection protocol in three different developing countries from Asia, Central and South America. These results reasonably suggest that there could be an association between safe sex beliefs and sexual initiation. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand this possible association as it could influence how to better promote sexual health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Osorio","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Burgo","given":"Cristina Lopez-del"},{"family":"Ruiz-Canela","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Carlos","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Irala","given":"Jokin","dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"osorio2015","container-title":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007826","ISSN":"2044-6055, 2044-6055","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e007826","PMID":"25916489","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","section":"Sexual health","source":"bmjopen.bmj.com","title":"Safe-sex belief and sexual risk behaviours among adolescents from three developing countries: a cross-sectional study","title-short":"Safe-sex belief and sexual risk behaviours among adolescents from three developing countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e007826","volume":"5"},

Little is known about the cognitive strategies that young people use to explain this inconsistency. The current study examined young people’s explanations for engaging in unprotected sexual activity in their committed relationships. A total of 63 young adults (32 women and 31 men) completed daily diaries over a 3-week period, providing a total of 1,284 daily reports tracking their condom use and non-use during intercourse. Diary collection was followed by in-depth interviews designed to explore participants’ decision-making regarding their participation in sexual intercourse unprotected against infection or unwanted pregnancy. Less than a quarter of the sample used condoms or oral contraceptives consistently. Participants primarily viewed condoms as a means of preventing pregnancy; few described disease prevention as a main motivation for their use. Analysis of the cognitions underlying explanations for condom and contraception non-use were classified as (1) general biased risk evaluation, (2) biased evidence evaluation, (3) endorsement of poor alternatives, (4) focus on spurious justifications, (5) dismissing risk, and (6) ignoring risk. Prevention interventions should incorporate methods to challenge young people to acknowledge personal risk and commit themselves to taking steps to reduce this risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Sullivan","given":"Lucia F."},{"family":"Udell","given":"Wadiya"},{"family":"Montrose","given":"Vernique A."},{"family":"Antoniello","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Susie"}],"citation-key":"osullivan2010","container-title":"Archives of Sexual Behavior","container-title-short":"Arch Sex Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s10508-009-9493-7","ISSN":"1573-2800","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1121-1131","source":"Springer Link","title":"A cognitive analysis of college students’ explanations for engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-009-9493-7","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"parkinson2011","abstract":"Much recent research has sought to uncover the neural basis of moral judgment. However, it has remained unclear whether \"moral judgments\" are sufficiently homogenous to be studied scientifically as a unified category. We tested this assumption by using fMRI to examine the neural correlates of moral judgments within three moral areas: (physical) harm, dishonesty, and (sexual) disgust. We found that the judgment of moral wrongness was subserved by distinct neural systems for each of the different moral areas and that these differences were much more robust than differences in wrongness judgments within a moral area. Dishonest, disgusting, and harmful moral transgression recruited networks of brain regions associated with mentalizing, affective processing, and action understanding, respectively. Dorsal medial pFC was the only region activated by all scenarios judged to be morally wrong in comparison with neutral scenarios.

The results establish a moral echoing effect—a tendency to credit a decision-maker with a good outcome when the decision-maker made the typical choices of the sure-thing in a gain frame or the risk in a loss frame, and to discredit the decision-maker when there is a bad outcome and the decision-maker made the atypical choices of a risk in a gain frame or a sure-thing in a loss frame. The moral echoing effect is established in Experiment 1 (n = 207) in which participants supposed the outcome would turn well or badly, and it is replicated in Experiment 2 (n = 173) in which they knew it had turned out well or badly, for judgments of moral responsibility and blame or praise. The effect does not occur for judgments of cause, control, counterfactual alternatives, or emotions.

The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between sexual agreements and partners' sexual relationship quality. Data were collected from both members of 161 gay male couples (n = 322 individuals). Couples were categorized as monogamous (52.8%), open (13.0%), monogamish (14.9%), and discrepant (19.3%). We used the actor−partner interdependence model (APIM) to assess associations of relationship arrangement with four aspects of sexual relationship quality: sexual satisfaction, sexual communication, sexual jealousy, and the occurrence of at-least weekly sex between main partners. We found that sexual arrangements were not associated with sexual satisfaction, communication, or frequency. However, monogamous men reported significantly higher levels of sexual jealousy. Our findings indicate that gay men engage in a range of relationship agreements, and nonmonogamous agreements are associated with levels of sexual relationship quality equivalent to monogamous agreements.

This study tested the contribution of reasons for using sexually explicit materials to beliefs in gender-role stereotypes about women and sexual conservatism, and acceptance of rape myths. Questionnaires were completed by 569 college students. Four motives for using erotica were identified: Sexual Enhancement, Diversion, Sexual Release, and Substitution. Sexual Enhancement was positively related to holding stereotyped and conservative beliefs about women and sex. Diversion and Sexual Enhancement were also indirectly related to greater acceptance of rape myths. Sexual Release was negatively linked and substitution was positively linked to acceptance of rape myths. The discussion highlights areas of support for the two models and points out the importance of future research to mitigate the effects of exposure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"PERSE","given":"ELIZABETH M."}],"citation-key":"perse1994","container-title":"Communication Research","container-title-short":"Communication Research","DOI":"10.1177/009365094021004003","ISSN":"0093-6502","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"488-515","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc; https://web.archive.org/web/20211207034557/https://journals.sagepub.com/action/cookieAbsent","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Uses of erotica and acceptance of rape myths","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/009365094021004003","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"petersen2013","abstract":"Over human evolutionary history, upper-body strength has been a major component of fighting ability. Evolutionary models of animal conflict predict that actors with greater fighting ability will more actively attempt to acquire or defend resources than less formidable contestants will. Here, we applied these models to political decision making about redistribution of income and wealth among modern humans. In studies conducted in Argentina, Denmark, and the United States, men with greater upper-body strength more strongly endorsed the self-beneficial position: Among men of lower socioeconomic status (SES), strength predicted increased support for redistribution; among men of higher SES, strength predicted increased opposition to redistribution. Because personal upper-body strength is irrelevant to payoffs from economic policies in modern mass democracies, the continuing role of strength suggests that modern political decision making is shaped by an evolved psychology designed for small-scale groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Sznycer","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Sell","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Cosmides","given":"Leda"},{"family":"Tooby","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"petersen2013","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797612466415","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1098-1103","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The ancestral logic of politics: upper-body strength regulates men’s assertion of self-interest over economic redistribution","title-short":"The ancestral logic of politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612466415","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"petersen2017","abstract":"Studies suggest the existence of an association between the physical formidability of human males and their level of aggression. This association is theoretically predictable from animal models of conflict behavior but could emerge from multiple different causal pathways. Previous studies have not been able to tease apart these paths, as they have almost exclusively relied on bivariate correlations and cross-sectional data. Here, we apply longitudinal twin data from two different samples to (1) estimate the direction of causality between formidability and aggression by means of quasi-experimental methods and (2) estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors by means of twin modeling. Importantly, the results suggest, on the one hand, that the association between formidability and aggression is less reliable than previously thought. On the other hand, the results also suggest that when the association occurs, the causal direction is from formidability to aggression and the primary part of the causal relationship is genetic in nature. These latter findings are consistent with adaptionist models suggesting that human male aggression is ‘reactively heritable’ to genetic components of formidability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Dawes","given":"Christopher T."}],"citation-key":"petersen2017","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2017.03.022","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,15]]},"language":"en","page":"161-166","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Assessing causal pathways between physical formidability and aggression in human males","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917301927","volume":"113"},

Most non-human primates are social, and manage the conflicts inherent to social living through the construction of dominance hierarchies. Consequently, multiple ritualized forms of facial expressions and salient indicators of social status have evolved to decrease the frequency of agonistic interactions between group-mates. The form and function of facial displays of dominance in non-human primates are related to species-typical social interactions, and the importance of facial interpretation in primates is reflected in their neurobiology. Homologies in the form and function of human and non-human primate facial displays of dominance have been posited, with relevance to human facial color, shape, eye gaze, and expressions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Rachel M."},{"family":"Dubuc","given":"Constance"},{"family":"Higham","given":"James P."}],"citation-key":"petersen2018","container-title":"The Facial Displays of Leaders","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-94535-4_6","editor":[{"family":"Senior","given":"Carl"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-94535-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"123-143","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Facial displays of dominance in non-human primates","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94535-4_6"},

Against earlier theories about authoritarianism and submissiveness, recent research shows that followers strategically promote dominant individuals to leadership positions in order to enhance their ability to aggress against other groups. Thus, recent evidence supports the existence of dedicated mechanisms for generating summary impressions of the dominance of potential leaders from a wealth of cues. Furthermore, research demonstrates how preferences for dominant leaders are heightened in contexts of conflict and among individuals prone to view the social world as conflictual. At the same time, this research shows that followers intuitively fear exploitation from dominant leaders and the political psychology of followership also contains dedicated mechanisms for identifying and counteracting such exploitation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Laustsen","given":"Lasse"}],"citation-key":"petersen2020","collection-title":"Power, Status and Hierarchy","container-title":"Current Opinion in Psychology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.copsyc.2019.07.005","ISSN":"2352-250X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"136-141","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dominant leaders and the political psychology of followership","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X19300764","volume":"33"},

Social-psychological research has adopted two broad theoretical approaches to the male gender role: trait perspectives, focusing on the sources and consequences of the extent to which men actually have characteristics culturally defined as masculine; and normative perspectives, deriving from the social constructionist view of gender roles, which concentrate on the nature and consequences of the standards by which cultures define masculinity. To illustrate the difference, a \"traditional\" male, in terms of gender-related personality traits, actually has culturally defined masculine characteristics. Using the normative perspective, this study examines the influence of masculinity ideology on adolescent males' behavior and attitudes in close heterosexual relationships. Masculinity ideology refers to beliefs about the importance of men adhering to culturally defined standards for male behavior, and the construct is operationalized by measures of attitudes toward the male gender role. The construct of masculinity ideology should be considered against the background of two earlier approaches to the male gender role.","author":[{"family":"Pleck","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Sonenstein","given":"Freya"},{"family":"Ku","given":"Leighton"}],"citation-key":"pleck1993","container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01166.x","ISSN":"0022-4537","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"19","title":"Masculinity ideology: its impact on adolescent males' heterosexual relationships.","type":"article-journal","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"prokosch2021","abstract":"Although humans' sense of smell is relatively diminished compared to other species, olfaction is still a central sensory modality through which people evaluate both potential threats and prospective romantic partners. Despite olfaction's role in interpersonal relationships and disease avoidant responses, however, it remains unknown whether variation in olfactory acuity is associated with disease- and mating-relevant psychological constructs and behaviors. In the current exploratory study, we examined the relationships between olfactory acuity, disgust sensitivity, and mating strategies in a sample of undergraduate students (N = 162) at a university in the Southern United States using an extended assessment of olfactory acuity (measuring olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification). Results revealed that people with greater discrimination acuity were higher in dispositional sexual disgust, but not pathogen or moral disgust. People with greater discrimination acuity were also less inclined towards short-term mating. Further, sexual disgust mediated the relationship between discrimination acuity and short-term mating orientation. These results provide further evidence for the importance of olfaction and olfaction-related disgust in close relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Prokosch","given":"Marjorie L."},{"family":"Airington","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Damian R."}],"citation-key":"prokosch2021","container-title":"Evolution and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Evolution and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2020.08.002","ISSN":"1090-5138","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"113-120","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Investigating the relationship between olfactory acuity, disgust, and mating strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513820300969","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"proust2010","abstract":"Given disagreement about the architecture of the mind, the nature of self‐knowledge, and its epistemology, the question of how to understand the function and the scope of metacognition – the control of one’s cognition – is still a matter of hot debate. A dominant view, the self‐ascriptive view, has been that metacognition necessarily requires representing one’s own mental states as mental states, and, therefore, necessarily involves an ability to read one’s mind. The main claims of this view are articulated, and the difficulties that they raise are discussed. An alternative view of metacognition, the ‘self‐evaluative view’, is then examined. It is argued that this view provides an account of metacognition that is both empirically and conceptually more adequate than the self‐ascriptive model. Particular attention is given to the problem of transferring self‐evaluative judgments to the case of others.","author":[{"family":"Proust","given":"Joëlle"}],"citation-key":"proust2010","container-title":"Philosophy Compass","DOI":"10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00340.x","ISSN":"1747-9991","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"989–998","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Metacognition","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

Participants were unmarried, noncohabiting Latinas ages 18–29 who were involved in primary heterosexual relationships. Survey data that were collected from participants included sociodemographics, relationship power, acculturation, and unprotected sex with primary and extradyadic partners. After statistically controlling for age and ethnic identity, the authors found that Latinas with less relationship power were signiﬁcantly more likely to report having unprotected sex with primary partners.

Their racial attitudes were measured via the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Results revealed that both the racial composition of the anticipated dyad and participants’ situational roles influenced automatic racial attitudes. Specifically, whites assigned to the high-power role of a superior of a black individual revealed more racial bias than whites assigned to the lower-power role of a subordinate. By contrast, situational power had no influence on the automatic bias of whites anticipating same-race interactions.

Among the 330 women who had had oral sex with a woman in the previous 6 months, 9.7% had used a dental dam and 2.1% had used one 'often'. There was little evidence of dam use for prevention of sexually transmissible infections. Although women who practised rimming (oral-anal contact) or had fetish sex involving blood were more likely to have used a dam, dam use was not significantly more common among women who had more partners, or had casual or group sex. Some women avoided oral sex during menstruation or had oral sex with a tampon in place.

In the present investigation, we examine factors that influence the decision to store information in-the-world versus in-the-head using a variant of a traditional short term memory task. In Experiments 1a and 1b participants were presented with to-be-remembered items and either had to rely solely on internal memory or had the option to write down the presented information. In Experiments 2a and 2b participants were presented with the same stimuli but made metacognitive judgments about their predicted performance and effort expenditure. The spontaneous use of external storage was related both to the number of items to be remembered and an individual’s actual and perceived short-term-memory capacity.

A framework for conducting community-based, empowerment research that draws on theories of community psychology, feminism, and postmodernism is presented. The study was designed to understand the dynamics of abusive lesbian relationships and social service providers' responses to the abuse. Results from 80 in-depth interviews with lesbians who have experienced relationship violence are examined with a particular focus on a pattern of first relationships being abusive and a theme of shifting power dynamics. Analysis of focus group discussions with 45 feminist service providers (e.g., counselors, shelter workers, social workers, healthcare providers) reveals the difficulties in assessing the power dynamics of abusive same-sex relationships and in developing appropriate responses when relying on heterosexually gendered models developed to address men's violence against women. The preliminary results present implications both for how we theorize and research this form of violence, and for improving the practices and policies of social services that work with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ristock","given":"Janice L."}],"citation-key":"ristock2003","container-title":"American Journal of Community Psychology","container-title-short":"Am J Community Psychol","DOI":"10.1023/A:1023971006882","ISSN":"1573-2770","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"329-341","source":"Springer Link","title":"Exploring dynamics of abusive lesbian relationships: preliminary analysis of a multisite, qualitative study","title-short":"Exploring dynamics of abusive lesbian relationships","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023971006882","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"rodgers2018","abstract":"Spitefulness is an under-studied individual difference that describes a dispositional tendency to seek harm against others at the expense of one's own objectives. Given that spiteful behavior involves a voluntary setback of one's own goals, it is noteworthy that no research to date has examined the self-regulatory and motivational correlates of spitefulness. In this research, we show that spitefulness is positively related to prevention regulatory focus and trait impulsiveness, and negatively related to approach temperament, suggesting that spitefulness is generally motivated by spontaneous concerns about threat avoidance. In contrast, spitefulness was not predicted by promotion regulatory focus, avoidance temperament, dispositional locomotion, or dispositional assessment in our regression model.","author":[{"family":"Rodgers","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Dahling","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"rodgers2018","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2017.11.020","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","page":"257","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Self-regulatory correlates of spitefulness","type":"article-journal","volume":"123"},
  {"id":"rodriguezbailon2000","abstract":"Power can be defined as control over other people's outcomes. Using this definition, we explored the impact of power on attentional processes involved in impression formation. Because powerful individuals may want to maintain and justify their position, powerful participants should pay particular attention to negative stereotype-consistent information about their subordinates. In contrast, powerless participants should devote their attention to stereotype-inconsistent information in an attempt to increase their control over the social context. Study 1 directly manipulated control by assigning participants to the role of leader or subordinate in a task group. Results showed that, compared to subordinates, leaders devoted more attention to negative stereotypic attributes. Study 2 manipulated the legitimacy of power and replicated the pattern found in Study 1 but only when power was illegitimate. Our findings suggest that the experience of power can be associated with feelings of threat, especially when power is illegitimate, thereby orienting impression-formation processes toward information likely to maintain the existing social structure. We discuss our results in the context of current work on motivated social cognition, social identity, and legitimisation.

  {"id":"rodrigueznieto2019","abstract":"Sexual behavior is the open manifestation of a complex interplay between psychophysiological mechanisms that either facilitate or inhibit sexual thoughts, desires, and associated behaviors. Whereas sexual excitation has been widely studied, less is known about the impact of inhibitory control mechanisms that enable individuals to refrain from sexual cognition and behavior. The present study examined: (1) the relationship between general and sexual inhibitory mechanisms (as measured through self-reports and computer-based tasks), (2) the relation between sexual inhibitory processes at cognitive and motor-motivational levels and with sexual inhibition as an individual trait, and (3) the predictive value of these parameters on sexual thoughts (cognition) and behavior. We demonstrate that general inhibitory control (i.e., the ability to suppress any preponderant response) and the specific inhibition of sexual responses represent distinct processes that require at least partly different control mechanisms. Similarly, the ability to inhibit sexual visual input and the ability to suppress sexually driven responses seem to be two independent processes. The different inhibitory processes distinctively predicted the frequency of sexual thoughts and sexual behavior. We propose that these different inhibitory mechanisms are at play during different phases of sexual regulation (before and after the generation and unfolding of sexual arousal) and that a specific deficit in one of these processes may underlie the distinctive symptomatology and comorbidity of sexual disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodriguez-Nieto","given":"Geraldine"},{"family":"Emmerling","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Dewitte","given":"Marieke"},{"family":"Sack","given":"Alexander T."},{"family":"Schuhmann","given":"Teresa"}],"citation-key":"rodrigueznieto2019","container-title":"Archives of Sexual Behavior","container-title-short":"Arch Sex Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s10508-018-1283-7","ISSN":"1573-2800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"481-494","source":"Springer Link","title":"The role of inhibitory control mechanisms in the regulation of sexual behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-018-1283-7","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"rogier2019","abstract":"Impulsivity seems closely related to both narcissism and spitefulness as a potential common pathway by which these pathological personality traits lead to violence. We administered the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, the Spitefulness Scale, and the Impulsive Behavior Scale Short Form to a sample of individuals convicted of violent offenses ( n = 182) and a sample of community participants ( n = 203). Hierarchical regression analysis of the convicted sample showed that spitefulness predicted AQ scores positively and significantly beyond the roles of both pathological narcissism and impulsivity. Finally, mediation analyses showed that impulsivity partially mediated the relationships between aggression and both grandiose narcissism and spitefulness. Our results support the hypothesis that spitefulness plays an important role in the prediction of aggressiveness. Finally, impulsivity seems to be a central common variable that explains the relationship between pathological personality traits and aggressive behavior among individuals convicted of violent offenses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogier","given":"Guyonne"},{"family":"Marzo","given":"Alessia"},{"family":"Velotti","given":"Patrizia"}],"citation-key":"rogier2019","container-title":"Criminal Justice and Behavior","container-title-short":"Criminal Justice and Behavior","DOI":"10.1177/0093854819862013","ISSN":"0093-8548, 1552-3594","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1475-1492","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Aggression among offenders: the complex interplay by grandiose narcissism, spitefulness, and impulsivity","title-short":"Aggression among offenders","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0093854819862013","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"rolison2019","abstract":"Research within the psychological risk-return framework, namely using the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale, has led to a conclusion that risk attitude—measured as an individual’s sensitivity to the risk they perceive—is stable across people (e.g., gender) and domains (e.g., recreational, social, financial, health). Risk-taking differences across gen-der and domain have been interpreted in terms of differences in the magnitude of risk per-ceived (and expected benefit). Yet, the DOSPERT scale items, contrived by researchers, ra-ther than decision-makers themselves, may have failed to detect differences in perceived risk attitude by failing to adequately represent all combinations of risks and benefits across gender and domains. In Study 1, participants generated their own examples of activities, which we selected among in Studies 2 and 3 to construct a new scale representing various levels of per-ceived risk and expected benefit. Our findings reveal that women are more sensitive than men to risk they perceive (i.e., are less tolerant of risk) in the recreational, social, and financial do-mains, but not the health domain. Risk attitude also differed across domains, with partici-pants tolerating more risk in some domains than in others. We conclude that gender and do-main differences in risk-taking stem partly from gender and domain differences in people’s sensitivity to perceived risks. Our findings have theoretical implications for the psychological risk-return framework and bridge with other theoretical approaches, such as the expected util-ity framework. Our studies also provide a new scale for assessing differences in attitudes to-ward risk that overcomes shortcomings of existing scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rolison","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Shenton","given":"Jeordie"}],"citation-key":"rolison2019","container-title":"Journal of Behavioral Decision Making","ISSN":"0894-3257","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Wiley","source":"repository.essex.ac.uk","title":"How much risk can you stomach?

Such inferences are open to question, however, because they nearly all rely on the same self-report instrument—the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin and Hall, 1979, Raskin and Hall, 1981)—to operationalize and measure narcissism. This is problematic because numerous NPI items do not appear to correspond to common definitions or manifestations of narcissism, and may instead be indicative of self-esteem. Two studies demonstrate that the NPI’s confound with self-esteem accounts for the purported relationship between narcissism and psychological health. This suggests that inferences about narcissism and psychological health may need to be reinterpreted. Results also highlight the need for measures that correspond more directly to core components of narcissism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenthal","given":"Seth A."},{"family":"Hooley","given":"Jill M."}],"citation-key":"rosenthal2010","container-title":"Journal of Research in Personality","container-title-short":"Journal of Research in Personality","DOI":"10/b42wg6","ISSN":"0092-6566","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"453-465","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Narcissism assessment in social–personality research: does the association between narcissism and psychological health result from a confound with self-esteem?","title-short":"Narcissism assessment in social–personality research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656610000668","volume":"44"},

Studies 2 and 3 examined associations of model variables with instruments measuring diverse qualities of relationships and assorted personal dispositions. As anticipated, Investment Model variables were moderately associated with other measures reflecting superior couple functioning (e.g., dyadic adjustment, trust level, inclusion of other in the self), and were essentially unrelated to measures assessing personal dispositions (e.g., need for cognition, self-esteem). In addition, Study 3 demonstrated that earlier measures of Investment Model variables predicted later levels of dyadic adjustment and later relationship status (persisted vs. ended).

Experiment 1 revealed that straight women perceive mating-relevant advice from a gay man to be more trustworthy than similar advice offered by a straight man or woman. Experiment 2 demonstrated that gay men perceive mating advice offered by a straight woman to be more trustworthy than advice offered by a lesbian woman or another gay man.

  {"id":"russock2011","abstract":"Sexual selection and parental investment theory have been used to study mate selection for many years and for much of that time has been applied to humans, with the prediction that humans will follow the general mammalian pattern. One aspect of human mate selection that has received much less attention is that of same sex mate selection. The present study used an analysis of 800 personal advertisements from print and online media to determine the mate selection criteria of four mating groups — males seeking females (MF), females seeking males (FM), males seeking males (MM) and females seeking females (FF). Consistent with results of earlier studies, heterosexual males (MF) in our study preferred significantly younger partners than heterosexual females (FM), offered physical attractiveness significantly less often than FM, sought resources significantly less often than FM and indicated a willingness to make a commitment significantly more often than FM. Homosexual females (FF) differed from heterosexual females by the same four criteria and in the same direction as heterosexual males, in clear contrast to hypotheses suggesting that homosexuals only differ from heterosexuals of the same gender in choice of sexual object. Homosexual males (MM) differed from heterosexual males in only two criteria, both of which exhibited an exaggerated male pattern, possibly because MM are unaffected by the sexual strategies of females; MM sought attractiveness (even) more than MF and offered resources less than MF. Homosexual men, thus, exhibited no evidence of selection on the mate preference characteristics predicted by sexual selection theory. In contrast, the proximate mate selection preferences of female homosexuals were consistent with the assumption that in their case procreation is irrelevant to mate selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Russock","given":"Howard I."}],"citation-key":"russock2011","container-title":"Behaviour","DOI":"10.1163/000579511x556600","ISSN":"0005-7959","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"307-323","publisher":"BRILL","source":"JSTOR","title":"An evolutionary interpretation of the effect of gender and sexual orientation on human mate selection preferences, as indicated by an analysis of personal advertisements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23034195","volume":"148"},

  {"id":"scannell2010","abstract":"How do individuals think about global climate change? Although a body of research on the cognitive elements of climate change has begun to accumulate (e.g., Bord, O'Connor, & Fisher, 2000, few studies have distinguished between categories of cognitions. One key distinction is between primary, direct thoughts such as perceptions and evaluations, and secondary, indirect thoughts which reflect upon and control primary cognitions (Petty, Brinol, Tormala, & Wegner, 2007); secondary thoughts are thus considered metacognitive. This distinction is important to climate change engagement given that primary and secondary thoughts may exert independent effects on behavior. Three metacognitive elements of climate change are delineated: metacognitive knowledge, or assessments of confidence in one's thoughts; metacognitive certainty, or assessments of the likelihood of an outcome; and metacognitive importance, or the relative emphasis placed on one's thoughts. The relations between these dimensions and climate change-relevant behaviors are explored. Possibilities for future research are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Scannell","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Grouzet","given":"Frederick M.

  {"id":"schaichborg2008","abstract":"Disgust, an emotion related to avoiding harmful substances, has been linked to moral judgments in many behavioral studies. However, the fact that participants report feelings of disgust when thinking about feces and a heinous crime does not necessarily indicate that the same mechanisms mediate these reactions. Humans might instead have separate neural and physiological systems guiding aversive behaviors and judgments across different domains. The present interdisciplinary study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 50) and behavioral assessment to investigate the biological homology of pathogen-related and moral disgust. We provide evidence that pathogen-related and sociomoral acts entrain many common as well as unique brain networks. We also investigated whether morality itself is composed of distinct neural and behavioral subdomains. We provide evidence that, despite their tendency to elicit similar ratings of moral wrongness, incestuous and nonsexual immoral acts entrain dramatically separate, while still overlapping, brain networks. These results (i) provide support for the view that the biological response of disgust is intimately tied to immorality, (ii) demonstrate that there are at least three separate domains of disgust, and (iii) suggest strongly that morality, like disgust, is not a unified psychological or neurological phenomenon.","author":[{"family":"Schaich Borg","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Kiehl","given":"Kent A."}],"citation-key":"schaichborg2008","container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Cogn Neurosci","DOI":"10.1162/jocn.2008.20109","ISSN":"0898-929X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"1529-1546","PMCID":"PMC3969035","PMID":"18345982","source":"PubMed","title":"Infection, incest, and iniquity: investigating the neural correlates of disgust and morality","title-short":"Infection, incest, and iniquity","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

Nearly all of these investigations have relied solely on samples from Western cultures. In the current study, responses from a cross-cultural survey of 30,470 people across 53 nations spanning 11 world regions (North America, Central/South America, Northern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern\nEurope, Southern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and East Asia) were used to evaluate whether narcissism (as measured by the Narcissistic Personality Inventory; NPI) was universally associated with short-term mating. Results revealed narcissism scores (including two broad factors and seven traditional facets as measured by the NPI) were functionally equivalent across cultures, reliably associating with key sexual outcomes (e.g., more active pursuit of short-term mating, intimate partner violence, and sexual aggression) and sex-related personality traits (e.g., higher extraversion and openness to experience). Whereas some features of personality (e.g., subjective well-being) were universally associated with socially adaptive facets of\nNarcissism (e.g., self-sufficiency), most indicators of short-term mating (e.g., unrestricted sociosexuality and marital infidelity) were universally associated with the socially maladaptive facets of narcissism (e.g., exploitativeness).

  {"id":"schnall2008","abstract":"Theories of moral judgment have long emphasized reasoning and conscious thought while downplaying the role of intuitive and contextual inﬂuences. However, recent research has demonstrated that incidental feelings of disgust can inﬂuence moral judgments and make them more severe. This study involved two experiments demonstrating that the reverse effect can occur when the notion of physical purity is made salient, thus making moral judgments less severe. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The ﬁndings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes, rather than deliberate reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection to moral purity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Schnall","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Benton","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Sophie"}],"citation-key":"schnall2008","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02227.x","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1219-1222","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"With a clean conscience: cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments","title-short":"With a clean conscience","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02227.x","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"schrift2011","abstract":"A great deal of research in consumer decision-making and social-cognition has explored consumers’ attempts to simplify choices by bolstering their tentative choice candidate and/or denigrating the other alternatives. The present research investigates a diametrically opposed process, whereby consumers complicate their decisions. The authors demonstrate that, in order to complicate their choices, consumers increase choice conflict by over-weighing small disadvantages of superior alternatives, converging overall evaluations of alternatives, reversing the ordinal value of attributes, and even choosing less preferred alternatives. Further, the results from five studies support a unifying theoretical framework, namely the effort-compatibility principle. Specifically, it is argued that consumers strive for compatibility between the effort they anticipate and the effort that they actually exert. When a certain decision seems more difficult than initially expected, a simplifying process ensues. However, when the decision feels easier to resolve than was anticipated (e.g., when consumers face an important, yet easy choice), consumers artificially increase their effort.","author":[{"family":"Schrift","given":"R.

  {"id":"schwartz2013","abstract":"In this chapter, we take the position that self-regulation and metacognition reveal an undeniable conceptual core that assumes individuals make efforts to monitor their thoughts and actions, and try to gain some control over them. In the neurosciences, the higher-order processes of monitoring and control are referred to as “executive control processes”—processes that should be evident as neurological activity within known neuroanatomical locations. From this vantage point, we closely examine two predominant cognitive models of working memory—Cowan’s embedded processing model and Baddeley’s model containing a central executive component. We conclude that the former is the best ﬁt with research from neuroscience and explains most efﬁciently the ﬁndings of metacognition in instruction. Thus, we offer a model of monitoring and control as a reciprocal function of the same neurologic processes that excite and inhibit, in a recursive fashion, the regions of the brain responsible for two types of activities involved in learning—the activities involved in processing the information itself relative to the goals of a task and the activities involved in processing (evaluating and correcting) the original activities deployed to seek goal attainment, activities that are metacognitive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Neil H."},{"family":"Scott","given":"Brianna M."},{"family":"Holzberger","given":"Doris"}],"citation-key":"schwartz2013","container-title":"International Handbook of Metacognition and Learning Technologies","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_6","editor":[{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Aleven","given":"Vincent"}],"event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-4419-5545-6 978-1-4419-5546-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"79-94","publisher":"Springer New York","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metacognition: A closed-loop model of biased Competition–Evidence from neuroscience, cognition, and instructional research","title-short":"Metacognition","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_6","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"shakeel2019","abstract":"BACKGROUNDMetacognition refers to the ability to evaluate and control our cognitive processes. While studies have investigated metacognition in schizophrenia and clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR), less is known about the potential mechanisms which result in metacognitive deficits. AIMSWe aimed to investigate whether neurocognitive functions including attention, working memory, verbal learning and executive functions predicted the tendency to focus on one's thoughts (cognitive self-consciousness) and beliefs in the efficacy of one's cognitive skills (cognitive confidence). METHODParticipants (130 CHR individuals) were recruited as part of the multi-site PREDICT study. They were assessed using the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ) as well as measures of executive function (WCST), attention (N-Back), working memory (LNS) and verbal learning (AVLT). RESULTSCognitive competence was negatively correlated with N-Back while cognitive self-consciousness was positively correlated with N-Back and LNS. Linear regression analysis with N-Back, AVLT, LNS and WCST as predictors showed that neurocognition significantly predicted cognitive self-consciousness, with N-Back, LNS and WCST as significant predictors. The model accounted for 14% of the variance in cognitive self-consciousness. However, neurocognition did not result in a significant predictive model of cognitive competence. CONCLUSIONSNeurocognition was associated with an increased focus on one's thoughts, but it was not associated with higher confidence in one's cognitive skills. Neurocognition accounted for less than one-sixth of the variance in metacognition, suggesting that interventions that target neurocognition are unlikely to improve metacognitive abilities.","author":[{"family":"Shakeel","given":"M.

  {"id":"silva2019","abstract":"This paper uses the 2013–2015 NSFG, a representative US-based dataset of individuals 15–44, to explore predictors of straight identification among all women and men and among subsets with substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction. After controlling for attractions and sexual practices, homophobia predicted straight identification in all groups. Among both groups of women, one femininity attitude and motherhood also predicted straight identification. One attitude reflecting alignment with normative masculinity significantly predicted straight identification among men with substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction. This paper also uses two waves of Add Health, a representative survey of young adults, to examine change to sexual identity over six years. Results show that among individuals who changed sexual identities between waves, heightened religiosity and political conservatism across waves were associated with increased odds of changing to a straight identity for women, but not for men. This suggests but does not prove a directional association between attitudes and identification for some individuals. Latent class analyses also found distinct groups of straight-identified men and women with substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction, indicating that it is a heterogeneous population in terms of attitudes, including homophobia. This suggests that straight identification is due partly to embeddedness in straight culture and enjoyment of straight privilege, not simply homophobia. While impossible to determine causality, the results show that straight identification is strongly related to non-sexual social factors, including religiosity and attitudes about sexuality and gender, in addition to attractions and sexual practices. The results also suggest that homophobia is related to identity formation for women, as well as men, but that there is substantial within-group variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Tony J"}],"citation-key":"silva2019","container-title":"Social Forces","container-title-short":"Social Forces","DOI":"10.1093/sf/soy064","ISSN":"0037-7732","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20211117181708/https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/97/3/1067/5045222; https://web.archive.org/web/20211126113947/https://academic.oup.com/crawlprevention/governor?content=%2Fsf%2Farticle%2F97%2F3%2F1067%2F5045222","page":"1067-1094","source":"Silverchair","title":"Straight Identity and Same-Sex Desire: Conservatism, Homophobia, and Straight Culture","title-short":"Straight Identity and Same-Sex Desire","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy064","volume":"97"},

Here, we investigate a density dependent dynamic model for the evolution of spite in populations of changing size. We extend the model by introducing a dynamic carrying capacity. Our analysis shows that it is possible for unconditionally spiteful behavior to evolve without population structure in any finite population. In some circumstances spiteful behavior can contribute to its own stability by limiting population growth. We use the model to show that there are differences between spite and altruism, and to refine Hamilton's original argument about the insignificance of spite in the wild.

We compared social judgments about male and female victims of heterosexual and homosexual rape and tested hypotheses concerning social cognitions that are assumed to underlie a male rape mythology. In a 2 × 2 × 2 design, 77 male and 89 female subjects made a series of judgments about a sexual assault case in which sex of victim and sex of assailants were manipulated. Consistent with the hypotheses, the male victim of sexual assault by females was judged more likely to have initiated or encouraged the sex acts, and more enjoyment and less stress were attributed to him. This pattern of results was more pronounced among male subjects. The results are discussed in relation to stereotypic beliefs concerning male sex roles, sexual motivation, and sexual functioning that are likely to affect the social cognitions of both observers and male victims of heterosexual assault.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Ronald E."},{"family":"Pine","given":"Charles J."},{"family":"Hawley","given":"Mark E."}],"citation-key":"smith1988","container-title":"The Journal of Sex Research","DOI":"10.1080/00224498809551401","ISSN":"0022-4499","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"page":"101-112","source":"JSTOR","title":"Social cognitions about adult male victims of female sexual assault","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/3812825","volume":"24"},

I propose that when we dehumanize others, we regard them as simultaneously human and subhuman.

  {"id":"smith2021","abstract":"Social influence is distributed unequally between males and females in many mammalian societies. In human societies, gender inequality is particularly evident in access to leadership positions. Understanding why women historically and cross-culturally have tended to be under-represented as leaders within human groups and organizations represents a paradox because we lack evidence that women leaders consistently perform worse than men. We also know that women exercise overt influence in collective group-decisions within small-scale human societies, and that female leadership is pervasive in particular contexts across non-human mammalian societies. Here we offer a transdisciplinary perspective on this female leadership paradox. Synthesis of social science and biological literatures suggests that females and males, on average, differ in why and how they compete for access to political leadership in mixed-gender groups. These differences are influenced by sexual selection and are moderated by socioecological variation across development and, particularly in human societies, by culturally transmitted norms and institutions. The interplay of these forces determines within and across species the emergence of female leaders. Furthermore, females may regularly exercise influence on group decisions in less conspicuous ways and different domains than males, and these underappreciated forms of leadership require more study. We offer a comprehensive framework for studying inequality between females and males in access to leadership positions, and we discuss the implications of this approach for understanding the female leadership paradox and for redressing gender inequality in leadership in humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Jennifer E."},{"family":"Rueden","given":"Christopher R.","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Vugt","given":"Mark","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Fichtel","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Kappeler","given":"Peter M."}],"citation-key":"smith2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"sokolowska2021","abstract":"The most salient characteristic of a risky choice is an approach–avoidance conflict—a desire to maximize benefits and minimize risk. This conflict is directly addressed in Risk–Value (R–V) models. Our goal is to determine to what extend the positive correlation between risk and value assumed in these models actually holds, as it is a necessary condition for trade-offs. If people do not perceive a R–V relation as positive, there is no conflict, and decisions may be made on the basis of either criterion according to a lexicographic strategy, whereby either the least risky or the most beneficial option is chosen. The dependence between perception of the R–V relation and decision strategies was tested in three studies performed with 411 university students. Experimental (Studies 1–3) and questionnaire (Studies 2–3) measurements were used. In experiments, participants rated riskiness of two-outcome lotteries and made choices between a lottery and a sure thing. The perceived R–V relation was also investigated by way of three scales in the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) questionnaire—willingness to take risk (RT), perceived risk (PR), and expected benefits (EB). Our findings support the hypothesis that perception of a positive R–V relation is necessary for trade-offs—the PR and EB scores are positively correlated for those, who make trade-offs. When the scores on the PR and EB scales are negatively correlated, preferences are described as a function of either perceived risk, or EB only.

A scale for measuring the frequency, likelihood, perceived benefit, and perceived risk of SRTB was developed. Young adult sexually active participants who did not have a stable partnership completed the above scale, as well as a scale of ADHD symptoms. Level of ADHD symptoms positively correlated with the frequency and likelihood of SRTB, even when the overall level of sexual behavior was controlled for. ADHD symptoms also correlated with the perceived benefit of SRTB, but not with the perceived risk of SRTB. Mediation analysis confirmed an indirect pathway: ADHD symptoms predicted perceived benefit of SRTB, which in turn predicted increased likelihood to engage in SRTB.

  {"id":"steinbeis2013","abstract":"Social comparison can elicit emotions such as envy, which can affect social interactions. The emergence and development of such social emotions through ontogeny, and their influence on social interaction, are unknown. We tested 182 children from 7 to 13years of age with a novel monetary reward-and-punishment task measuring envy and Schadenfreude (i.e., gloating or taking delight in someone else’s misfortune). Children were either rewarded or punished in a trial-by-trial evaluation of their performance on a speeded reaction time task. In a social condition, feedback of their own and a competitor’s performance was given for each trial. Afterward, children rated how they felt about the outcome. The ratings suggest that when children won, they felt better if the competitor lost instead of winning (i.e., Schadenfreude). Conversely, when children lost, they felt worse if the competitor won instead of losing (i.e., envy). Crucially, levels of envy and Schadenfreude decreased with age. We also studied how these emotions relate to social decisions made separately during three resource allocation paradigms. In each, children chose between two options that differed in the distribution of valuable tokens between themselves and an anonymous other. The combination of choices allowed the measurement of inequity aversion (i.e., equality for all) and spite (i.e., self-profit to maximal disadvantage of the other). We found an age-related increase in inequity aversion and decrease in spite. Crucially, age-related changes in both envy and Schadenfreude predicted the developmental change in equity-related decisions.

  {"id":"stoeber2017","abstract":"The perfectionism social disconnection model (PSDM; Hewitt, Flett, Sherry, & Caelian, 2006) makes an important contribution to perfectionism research explaining why perfectionism is associated with social disconnection and interpersonal hostility. Moreover, recent expansions of the PSDM suggest that the model applies to all forms of perfectionism. The present research challenges this suggestion. Three university student samples (Ns=318, 417, and 398) completed measures of self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism together with measures of trust, empathy, and hostility including aggression, anger, and spitefulness. In line with previous studies examining unique relationships of the three forms of perfectionism, only other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism showed a consistent pattern of unique relationships indicative of social disconnection and hostility. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism showed unique relationships indicative of social connection (and low hostility regarding physical aggression and spitefulness). The present findings indicate that the PSDM may not apply to all forms of perfectionism. Not all perfectionists feel socially disconnected and hostile towards others. Self-oriented perfectionists may feel socially connected and show no higher hostility than non-perfectionists, particularly when they are low in other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Stoeber","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Noland","given":"Andrew B."},{"family":"Mawenu","given":"Theresia W.

  {"id":"suessenbach2019","abstract":"The power motive predicts influential social behaviour; however, its heterogeneous conceptualisations have produced inconsistent results. To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6).

  {"id":"suter2011","abstract":"Do moral judgments hinge on the time available to render them? According to a recent dual-process model of moral judgment, moral dilemmas that engage emotional processes are likely to result in fast deontological gut reactions. In contrast, consequentialist responses that tot up lives saved and lost in response to such dilemmas would require cognitive control to override the initial response. Cognitive control, however, takes time. In two experiments, we manipulated the time available to arrive at moral judgments in two ways: by allotting a ﬁxed short or large amount of time, and by nudging people to answer swiftly or to deliberate thoroughly. We found that faster responses indeed lead to more deontological responses among those moral dilemmas in which the killing of one to save many necessitates manhandling an innocent person and in which this action is depicted as a means to an end. Thus, our results are the ﬁrst demonstration that inhibiting cognitive control through manipulations of time alters moral judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Suter","given":"Renata S."},{"family":"Hertwig","given":"Ralph"}],"citation-key":"suter2011","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2011.01.018","ISSN":"00100277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6]]},"language":"en","page":"454-458","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Time and moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027711000448","volume":"119"},

We review current thinking on the distinction between shame and guilt, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two moral emotions. Several new areas of research are highlighted: research on the domain-specific phenomenon of body shame, styles of coping with shame, psychobiological aspects of shame, the link between childhood abuse and later proneness to shame, and the phenomena of vicarious or “collective” experiences of shame and guilt. In recent years, the concept of moral emotions has been expanded to include several positive emotions—elevation, gratitude, and the sometimes morally relevant experience of pride.

Across studies, SPMS was unrelated to trust in others and to trustworthiness, as measured by the trust game, and unrelated to fairness, as measured by the dictator game.

We also examined the psychometric structure of each measure using Rasch model item analysis (Rasch, 1966).\nMETHOD: Two equivalent cohorts of entering freshman males (N = 994 and N = 1043) from a large northeastern university completed online measures at the end of their first semester.\nRESULTS: Identical proportions of men reported using intoxication strategies (3%) and physical force (1%) during the past semester on both measures. However, more men reported verbal strategies on the SSS (7.8%) compared with the SES (3.7%), even when restricting to equivalent items. Rasch analysis suggested that the SSS conformed better to a unidimensional continuum of perpetration severity than the SES; however, Rasch analysis did not provide definitive support for either a tactic - based (SSS) nor a tactic plus outcome- based (SES) hierarchy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both measures functioned adequately. However, the SSS may be preferred for its better Rasch properties, better assessment of the less severe tactics, and simpler wording.","author":[{"family":"Testa","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Joseph H."},{"family":"Lucke","given":"Joseph F."},{"family":"Pagnan","given":"Colleen E."}],"citation-key":"testa2015","container-title":"Psychology of Violence","container-title-short":"Psychol Violence","DOI":"10.1037/a0037584","ISSN":"2152-0828","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"285-293","PMCID":"PMC4564114","PMID":"26366321","source":"PubMed","title":"Measuring sexual aggression perpetration in college men: A comparison of two measures","title-short":"Measuring sexual aggression perpetration in college men","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

We conduct experiments in three different countries (Sweden, Austria, and the United States) involving over 1,400 subjects. All subjects responded to four trolley type dilemmas and four dictator games involving different charitable causes. Decisions were made under time pressure/time delay or while experiencing cognitive load or control. Overall we find converging evidence that intuitive states do not influence moral decisions. Neither time-pressure nor cognitive load had any effect on moral judgments or altruistic behavior. Thus we find no supporting evidence for the claim that intuitive moral judgments and dictator game giving differ from more reflectively taken decisions. Across all samples and decision tasks men were more likely to make utilitarian moral judgments and act selfishly compared to women, providing further evidence that there are robust gender differences in moral decision-making.

Results support the hypothesis that social context affects how superiors use their power to interact with subordinates. High- and low-power superiors in cooperation had positive expectations, interacted constructively, restated the task, responded to requests for assistance, and developed a positive relationship compared to high- and low-power superiors in individualistic and competitive situations. In addition, only the high-power superiors in cooperation used their expertise to give direct aid to the subordinate. Results indicate that in cooperation superiors are likely to use their power constructively; however, in competitive and individualistic contexts, superiors are apt to fail to use their resources to facilitate subordinate performance.

  {"id":"tooke1991","abstract":"The act frequency approach (Buss 1988) was used to develop a taxonomy of deceptive mating acts and tactics and to investigate hypothesized sex differences in the use of these acts and tactics. The results indicate that males show differences in the types of deceptive acts and tactics used in intersexual versus intrasexual contexts. Intrasexually, males more frequently engage in deceptive acts and tactics related to the exaggeration of superiority and exaggeration of sexual promiscuity, intensity, and popularity. More frequent deceptive intersexual acts and tactics for males include feigned commitment, feigned sincerity, and feigned resource acquisition ability. Females more frequently engage in deceptive acts and tactics related to appearance alteration in both intersexual and intrasexual contexts.

These findings suggest that the dimensions of deception characteristic of male reproductive strategies are congruent with female mate selection criteria and the dimensions of deception characteristic of female reproductive strategies are congruent with male mate selection criteria.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the extent to which moral judgments of physical and psychological harms are processed similarly, focusing on brain regions implicated in mental state reasoning or theory of mind, a key cognitive process for moral judgment. First, univariate analyses reveal item-speciﬁc features that lead to greater recruitment of theory of mind regions for psychological harm versus physical harm. Second, multivariate pattern analyses reveal sensitivity to the psychological/physical distinction in two regions implicated in theory of mind: the right temporoparietal junction and the precuneus. Third, we ﬁnd no reliable differences between neurotypical adults and adults with autism spectrum disorder with regard to neural activity related to theory of mind during moral evaluations of psychological and physical harm. Altogether, these results reveal neural sensitivity to the distinction between psychological harm and physical harm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsoi","given":"Lily"},{"family":"Dungan","given":"James A"},{"family":"Chakroff","given":"Aleksandr"},{"family":"Young","given":"Liane L"}],"citation-key":"tsoi2018","container-title":"Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1093/scan/nsy029","ISSN":"1749-5016, 1749-5024","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"460-470","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neural substrates for moral judgments of psychological versus physical harm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/13/5/460/4990259","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"tuoyire2018","abstract":"The timing of first sexual intercourse (FSI) has been linked with subsequent sexual risk-taking behaviours and associated negative health outcomes. Nonetheless, there is a lack of multi-countries studies exploring the relationship between timing of FSI and subsequent number of sexual partnerships. Our aim in this paper was to aggregate evidence from 34 sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the association between age at FSI and lifetime number of sexual partners, using Demographic and Health Survey data. Descriptive and multilevel mixed effects Poisson regression techniques were applied to the data. The findings reveal a significant association between age at FSI and subsequent number of lifetime sexual partners. This association remained post adjusting for education, wealth, marital status and residence for both men and women. Beyond these, the results showed that wealth worked in opposite direction in men and women—higher wealth status was protective for women while it exposed men to higher number of lifetime sexual partners. Higher education exposed both women and men to increased number of lifetime partnerships. We conclude that there is an association between delayed onset of sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners over time, regardless of gender and socio-demographic background. Sexual and reproductive health programmes calling for sexual partner reduction should focus more on age of sexual debut while factoring in the influence of the various socio-demographic dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuoyire","given":"Derek Anamaale"},{"family":"Anku","given":"Prince Justin"},{"family":"Alidu","given":"Laila"},{"family":"Amo-Adjei","given":"Joshua"}],"citation-key":"tuoyire2018","container-title":"Sexuality & Culture","container-title-short":"Sexuality & Culture","DOI":"10.1007/s12119-017-9488-9","ISSN":"1936-4822","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"651-668","source":"Springer Link","title":"Timing of first sexual intercourse and number of lifetime sexual partners in sub-saharan africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-017-9488-9","volume":"22"},

Whereas traditional models have suggested that disgust serves to protect the self or neutralize reminders of our animal nature, an evolutionary perspective suggests that disgust functions to solve 3 qualitatively different adaptive problems related to pathogen avoidance, mate choice, and social interaction. The authors investigated this 3-domain model of disgust across 4 studies and examined how sensitivity to these functional domains relates to individual differences in other psychological constructs. Consistent with their predictions, factor analyses demonstrated that disgust sensitivity partitions into domains related to pathogens, sexuality, and morality. Further, sensitivity to the 3 domains showed predictable differentiation based on sex, perceived vulnerability to disease, psychopathic tendencies, and Big 5 personality traits. In exploring these 3 domains of disgust, the authors introduce a new measure of disgust sensitivity.

  {"id":"tybur2013","abstract":"Interest in and research on disgust has surged over the past few decades. The field, however, still lacks a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the evolved function or functions of disgust. Here we present such a framework, emphasizing 2 levels of analysis: that of evolved function and that of information processing. Although there is widespread agreement that disgust evolved to motivate the avoidance of contact with disease-causing organisms, there is no consensus about the functions disgust serves when evoked by acts unrelated to pathogen avoidance. Here we suggest that in addition to motivating pathogen avoidance, disgust evolved to regulate decisions in the domains of mate choice and morality. For each proposed evolved function, we posit distinct information processing systems that integrate function-relevant information and account for the trade-offs required of each disgust system. By refocusing the discussion of disgust on computational mechanisms, we recast prior theorizing on disgust into a framework that can generate new lines of empirical and theoretical inquiry.","author":[{"family":"Tybur","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Kurzban","given":"Robert"},{"family":"DeScioli","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"tybur2013","container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1037/a0030778","ISSN":"1939-1471","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"65-84","PMID":"23205888","source":"PubMed","title":"Disgust: evolved function and structure","title-short":"Disgust","type":"article-journal","volume":"120"},
  {"id":"tybur2018","abstract":"People vary in the degree to which they experience disgust toward—and, consequently, avoid—cues to pathogens. Prodigious work has measured this variation and observed that it relates to, among other things, personality, psychopathological tendencies, and moral and political sentiments. Less work has sought to generate hypotheses aimed at explaining why this variation exists in the first place, and even less work has evaluated how well data support these hypotheses. In this paper, we present and review the evidence supporting three such proposals. First, researchers have suggested that variability reflects a general tendency to experience anxiety or emotional distress. Second, researchers have suggested that variability arises from parental modelling, with offspring calibrating their pathogen avoidance based on their parents' reactions to pathogen cues. Third, researchers have suggested that individuals calibrate their disgust sensitivity to the parasite stress of the ecology in which they develop. We conclude that none of these hypotheses is supported by existing data, and we propose directions for future research aimed at better understanding this variation., This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue ‘Evolution of pathogen and parasite avoidance behaviours’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tybur","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Çınar","given":"Çağla"},{"family":"Karinen","given":"Annika K."},{"family":"Perone","given":"Paola"}],"citation-key":"tybur2018","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2017.0204","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1751","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,19]]},"PMCID":"PMC6000141","PMID":"29866917","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Why do people vary in disgust?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6000141/","volume":"373"},

  {"id":"uhlmann2015","abstract":"Both normative theories of ethics in philosophy and contemporary models of moral judgment in psychology have focused almost exclusively on the permissibility of acts, in particular whether acts should be judged on the basis of their material outcomes (consequentialist ethics) or on the basis of rules, duties, and obligations (deontological ethics). However, a longstanding third perspective on morality, virtue ethics, may offer a richer descriptive account of a wide range of lay moral judgments. Building on this ethical tradition, we offer a person-centered account of moral judgment, which focuses on individuals as the unit of analysis for moral evaluations rather than on acts. Because social perceivers are fundamentally motivated to acquire information about the moral character of others, features of an act that seem most informative of character often hold more weight than either the consequences of the act or whether a moral rule has been broken. This approach, we argue, can account for numerous empirical findings that are either not predicted by current theories of moral psychology or are simply categorized as biases or irrational quirks in the way individuals make moral judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Uhlmann","given":"Eric Luis"},{"family":"Pizarro","given":"David A."},{"family":"Diermeier","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"uhlmann2015","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691614556679","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"language":"en","page":"72-81","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A person-centered approach to moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614556679","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"vaccaro2018","abstract":"Metacognition supports reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes. Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human psychology, its neural substrates remain underdetermined, partly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive judgement under study. It is also unclear how metacognition relates to other apparently similar abilities that depend on recursive thought such as theory of mind or mentalising. Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different analysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood estimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related activation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of confidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We found preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due to fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to meta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition and mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaccaro","given":"Anthony G."},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Stephen M."}],"citation-key":"vaccaro2018","container-title":"Brain and Neuroscience Advances","container-title-short":"Brain Neurosci Adv","DOI":"10.1177/2398212818810591","ISSN":"2398-2128","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]]},"PMCID":"PMC6238228","PMID":"30542659","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Thinking about thinking: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of metacognitive judgements","title-short":"Thinking about thinking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238228/","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"vankleef2021","abstract":"Risk-taking can fuel innovation and growth, but it can also have devastating consequences for individuals and organizations. Here we examine whether risk-taking affords social-hierarchical benefits to risk-takers. Specifically, we investigate how risk-taking influences perceived dominance, prestige, and the willingness to endorse risk-takers' leadership. Integrating insights from costly signaling theory and the dominance/prestige framework of social rank, we theorized that risk-taking increases leadership endorsement to the degree that it fuels perceptions of prestige, but decreases leadership endorsement to the degree that it fuels perceptions of dominance. However, we also hypothesized that risk-induced perceptions of dominance do translate into leadership endorsement in competitive (rather than cooperative) intergroup settings. We tested these hypotheses in four studies involving different samples, methods, and operationalizations. In Study 1, participants performed an implicit association test (IAT) that revealed that people associate risk with leader positions, and safety with follower positions. Study 2 was a longitudinal field survey conducted during the September 2019 Israeli elections, which showed that voters' perceptions of politicians' risk-taking propensities prior to the elections positively predicted perceived dominance and prestige as well as voting behavior during the elections. Finally, Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that people are willing to support risk-takers as leaders in the context of competitive (as opposed to cooperative) intergroup situations, because perceived dominance positively predicts leadership endorsement in competitive (but not cooperative) intergroup settings. We discuss implications for understanding the social dynamics of organizational rank and the perpetuation of risky behavior in organizations, politics, and society at large.

In a world of risk (“small world”), all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are known. In uncertain (“large”) worlds, some of this information is unknown or unknowable. Most of cognitive neuroscience studies exclusively study the neural correlates for decisions under risk (e.g., lotteries), with the tacit implication that understanding these would lead to an understanding of decision making in general. First, we show that normative strategies for decisions under risk do not generalize to uncertain worlds, where simple heuristics are often the more accurate strategies. Second, we argue that the cognitive processes for making decisions in a world of risk are not the same as those for dealing with uncertainty. Because situations with known risks are the exception rather than the rule in human evolution, it is unlikely that our brains are adapted to them.

These obstacles include (a) mismatches between modern and ancestral environments, (b) evolved cognitive biases affecting leader selection and decision-making and (c) innate psychological mechanisms designed to dominate and exploit other individuals. Understanding the evolved psychological mechanisms underlying leadership, in terms of adaptive functions, mismatches, and psychological processes, is critical for the development and integration of leadership theory, research, and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Vugt","given":"Mark","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Ronay","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"vugt2014","container-title":"Organizational Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Organizational Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1177/2041386613493635","ISSN":"2041-3866","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"74-95","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The evolutionary psychology of leadership: theory, review, and roadmap","title-short":"The evolutionary psychology of leadership","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2041386613493635","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"wagner2012","abstract":"Men who have sex with men (MSM) may account for most new HIV infections in Lebanon, yet little is known about the factors that influence sexual risk behavior and HIV testing in this population. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 31 MSM living in Beirut, and content analysis was used to identify emergent themes. Mean age of the participants was 28.4 years, and all identified as either gay (77%) or bisexual (23%). Half reported not using condoms consistently and one quarter had not been HIV-tested. Many described not using condoms with a regular partner in the context of a meaningful relationship, mutual HIV testing, and a desire to not use condoms, suggesting that trust, commitment and intimacy play a role in condom use decisions. Condoms were more likely to be used with casual partners, partners believed to be HIV-positive, and with partners met online where men found it easier to candidly discuss HIV risk. Fear of infection motivated many to get HIV tested and use condoms, but such affect also led some to avoid HIV testing in fear of disease and social stigma if found to be infected. Respondents who were very comfortable with their sexual orientation and who had disclosed their sexuality to family and parents tended to be more likely to use condoms consistently and be tested for HIV. These findings indicate that similar factors influence the condom use and HIV testing of MSM in Beirut as those observed in studies elsewhere of MSM; hence, prevention efforts in Lebanon can likely benefit from lessons learned and interventions developed in other regions, particularly for younger, gay-identified men. Further research is needed to determine how prevention efforts may need to be tailored to address the needs of men who are less integrated into or do not identify with the gay community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Glenn J."},{"family":"Aunon","given":"Frances M."},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Rachel L."},{"family":"Rana","given":"Yashodhara"},{"family":"Khouri","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Tohme","given":"Johnny"},{"family":"Mokhbat","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"wagner2012","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0045566","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,18]]},"PMCID":"PMC3445492","PMID":"23029103","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A qualitative exploration of sexual risk and HIV testing behaviors among men who have sex with men in beirut, lebanon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445492/","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"wakschlag2005","abstract":"This paper presents the clinical/developmental framework underlying a new diagnostic observational tool, the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS). The special importance of observation for clinical assessment during the preschool period is delineated. The developmental rationale for a multi-dimensional assessment of disruptive behavior in young children, including problems in modulation of negative affect and low competence is discussed. The ways in which the DB-DOS will elucidate distinctions between normative and atypical behavior during this developmental period via (a) the integration of qualitative and quantitative dimensions of behavior within a clinically-sensitive coding system, (b) the observation of child behavior both within, and outside of, the parent–child context and (c) the use of specially designed tasks to “press” for clinically salient behaviors are addressed. The promise of this new method for yielding a more precise, developmentally based description of the phenotype of early onset disruptive behavior problems and for providing a standardized clinical tool for observational assessment of disruptive behavior in young children is presented. Large-scale validation of the measure is currently underway.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wakschlag","given":"Lauren S."},{"family":"Leventhal","given":"Bennett L."},{"family":"Briggs-Gowan","given":"Margaret J."},{"family":"Danis","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Keenan","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Carri"},{"family":"Egger","given":"Helen L."},{"family":"Cicchetti","given":"Domenic"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Alice S."}],"citation-key":"wakschlag2005","container-title":"Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10567-005-6664-5","ISSN":"1573-2827","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"183-201","source":"Springer Link","title":"Defining the “disruptive” in preschool behavior: what diagnostic observation can teach us","title-short":"Defining the “disruptive” in preschool behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-005-6664-5","volume":"8"},

On the one hand, the application of social psychology to consumer behavior is meant to broaden the horizon of social psychologists. On the other hand, students and researchers of consumer behavior will be offered an advanced account of relevant theories tailored to their interests. While the range of topics is rather broad – including the construal of judgments and decisions, affective and cognitive feelings, social and media influences, and goals and self-regulation – each chapter is focused on one specific theoretical or methodological perspective and thereby gives a comprehensive and penetrative account of the relevant issues and the respective research.

  {"id":"weber2002","abstract":"We present a psychometric scale that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. Respondents rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities (Part I). An optional Part II assesses respondents' perceptions of the magnitude of the risks and expected benefits of the activities judged in Part I. The scale's construct validity and consistency is evaluated for a sample of American undergraduate students. As expected, respondents' degree of risk taking was highly domain-specific, i.e. not consistently risk-averse or consistently risk-seeking across all content domains. Women appeared to be more risk-averse in all domains except social risk. A regression of risk taking (likelihood of engaging in the risky activity) on expected benefits and perceived risks suggests that gender and content domain differences in apparent risk taking are associated with differences in the perception of the activities' benefits and risk, rather than with differences in attitude towards perceived risk.

However, our understanding of these beliefs and their relationship with symptoms in adolescents with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis is limited. Methods The Metacognitions Questionnaire short form (MCQ-30) was administered to 31 adolescents with an identified ARMS. Scores were subsequently compared to a control group of 76 adolescents drawn from a community population. Results As predicted, ARMS patients scored significantly higher on metacognition subscales, with negative beliefs (F = 42.97, P = 0.001), cognitive confidence (F = 17.11, P = 0.001) and need for control (F = 22.48, P = 0.001) subscales of the MCQ-30 distinguishing them from the comparison group.

In the truth and bias model, judgments about the world are pulled by 2 primary forces, the truth force and the bias force, and these 2 forces are interrelated. The truth and bias model differentiates force and value, where the force is the strength of the attraction and the value is the location toward which the judgment is attracted. The model also makes a formal theoretical distinction between bias and moderator variables. Two major classes of biases are discussed: biases that are measured with variables (e.g., assumed similarity) and directional bias, which refers to the extent to which judgments are pulled toward 1 end of the judgment continuum. Moderator variables are conceptualized as variables that affect the accuracy and bias forces but that do not affect judgments directly. We illustrate the model with 4 examples.

We hypothesize that power can indeed create opportunities for sexual aggression— but that it is those who chronically experience low power who will choose to exploit such opportunities. Here, low-power men placed in a high-power role showed the most hostility in response to a denied opportunity with an attractive woman (Studies 1 and 2). Chronically low-power men and women given acute power were the most likely to say they would inappropriately pursue an unrequited workplace attraction (Studies 3 and 4). Finally, having power over an attractive woman increased harassment behavior among men with chronic low, but not high, power (Study 5).

  {"id":"winter2016","abstract":"Power is a necessary dimension of all human enterprises. It can inspire and illuminate, but it can also corrupt, oppress, and destroy. Therefore, taming power has been a central moral and political question for most of human history. Writers, theorists, and researchers have suggested many methods and mechanisms for taming power: through affiliation and love, intellect and reason, responsibility, religion and values, democratic political structures, and separation of powers. Historical examples and social science research suggest that each has some success, but also that each is vulnerable to being hijacked by power itself. I therefore introduce generative historical consciousness (GHC) as a concept and measure that might help to secure the benefits of power while protecting against its outrages and excesses. I conclude by discussing the role that GHC may have played in the peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Winter","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"winter2016","container-title":"American Psychologist","container-title-short":"American Psychologist","DOI":"10.1037/a0039312","ISSN":"1935-990X, 0003-066X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"160-174","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Taming power: generative historical consciousness.","title-short":"Taming power","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0039312","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"witkower2020","abstract":"Converging evidence suggests that high rank is communicated through various nonverbal behaviors (e.g., expansiveness), but prior studies have not examined whether 2 distinct forms of high rank—known as prestige and dominance—are communicated through distinct nonverbal displays. Given the divergent messages that prestigious and dominant leaders need to send in order to attain and retain their place in the social hierarchy, theoretical accounts would suggest that individuals use distinct sets of nonverbal behaviors to communicate these 2 forms of high rank. In the present research, we tested this hypothesis in 7 studies, using carefully controlled experimental designs (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b) and the assessment of spontaneously displayed nonverbal behaviors that occurred during a lab-based group interaction (Study 5) and a real-world political contest (Study 6). Results converged across studies to show that prestige and dominance strategies are associated with distinct sets of nonverbal behaviors, which are largely consistent with theoretical predictions. Specifically, prestige, or the attainment of rank through earned respect, and dominance, or the use of intimidation and force to obtain power, are communicated from different head positions (i.e., tilted upward vs. downward), smiling behaviors (i.e., presence vs. absence of a symmetrical smile), and different forms of bodily expansion (i.e., subtle chest expansion vs. more grandiose space-taking). These findings provide the first evidence for 2 distinct signals of high rank, which spontaneously emerge in social interactions and guide social perceptions and the conferral of power.

  {"id":"wlodarski2015","abstract":"Humans display a wide variety of mating strategies, ranging from short-term (promiscuous) strategies to long-term (monogamous) strategies. It has been previously suggested that certain personality factors, including individual differences in empathy, may be related to the pursuit of differing mating strategies. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationships between different forms of empathy and the inclination towards pursuing a short-term mating strategy, as indexed by sociosexuality. It was found that cognitive empathy abilities were positively associated with higher levels of sociosexuality, though much more so for individuals who were also high in affective empathy. When examining the various sub-components that make up sociosexuality, it was found this effect may be driven by the desire aspect of sociosexuality. It appears, therefore, that the ability to cognitively understand the emotional state of other individuals is related to promiscuous mating strategies, especially when combined with the ability to intuitively feel the emotions of the other individual.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wlodarski","given":"Rafael"}],"citation-key":"wlodarski2015","container-title":"Evolutionary Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Evolutionary Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1007/s40806-015-0027-3","ISSN":"2198-9885","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"language":"en","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20211116104630/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40806-015-0027-3","page":"232-240","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Relationship Between Cognitive and Affective Empathy and Human Mating Strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-015-0027-3","volume":"1"},

The present study sought to examine the nature, frequency, and determinants of self-reported complaints of prospective memory (ProM) in HIV, which is a singly dissociable and ecologically relevant aspect of episodic memory involving the execution of future intentions. Seventy-five HIV seropositive individuals and 60 seronegative volunteers were administered the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PMRQ) as part of extensive neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical research assessments. The HIV sample endorsed more frequent ProM complaints in daily life than the seronegative group, particularly on items requiring self-initiated cue detection and retrieval. Within both study groups, ProM complaints were significantly more frequent than RetM complaints. Although the HIV sample was impaired relative to the seronegative group on an objective, performance-based ProM test, selfreported ProM complaints did not correspond to actual ProM abilities. However, greater frequency of self-reported ProM complaints was moderately associated with increased fatigue, as well as with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Consistent with prior research on RetM in HIV, results indicate that affective distress contributes to a metamemory deficit for HIV-associated ProM impairment, which highlights the potential importance of assessing both self-reported and performance-based ProM in clinical and research neuroAIDS evaluations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Woods","given":"S"},{"family":"Carey","given":"C"},{"family":"Moran","given":"L"},{"family":"Dawson","given":"M"},{"family":"Letendre","given":"S"},{"family":"Grant","given":"I"}],"citation-key":"woods2007","container-title":"Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology","container-title-short":"Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.acn.2006.12.006","ISSN":"08876177","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,2]]},"language":"en","page":"187-195","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Frequency and predictors of self-reported prospective memory complaints in individuals infected with HIV","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/acn/article-lookup/doi/10.1016/j.acn.2006.12.006","volume":"22"},

The current study examines how gender, sexual identity, personal experiences with rape (i.e., knowing/being a survivor), feminist identity, patriarchal gender norms, attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and the interactions among these relate to LGB college students’ (n = 389; 24% gay/lesbian, 19% bisexual, 57% mostly heterosexual) RMA using the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale–Short Form. Findings show that being a woman, being LGB, identifying as a feminist, and knowing/being a survivor are all negatively related to RMA, whereas patriarchal gender norms are positively related to RMA. Attitudes toward LGBT people had differing effects whereby attitudes toward gay men were unassociated with RMA, attitudes toward lesbian women and trans men were negatively associated with RMA, and attitudes toward bisexual men and women and trans women differed depending on the comparison reference group (exclusive heterosexuals, n = 1,551, mostly heterosexuals, n = 222). Furthermore, the interacting effects of these identities, experiences, and perspectives also revealed significant findings that add complexity to these relationships. Overall, this research seeks to fill the gaps in the literature, expand our knowledge about rape myths, and contribute to new lines of inquiry that focus on LGB people’s perspectives to work toward a deeper understanding of rape myths, so that ultimately, these damaging perspectives can be dispelled.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Worthen","given":"Meredith G.

We investigated whether experiencing powerlessness induces the experience of self-dehumanization using three methods: priming, role-playing, and cueing. People in a position of low power viewed themselves (Experiments 1–3) as less human relative to people in a position of high power; furthermore, people with low power believed that they were viewed as less human by others as well (Experiments 2–3). In all of the experiments, human nature traits were most negatively affected by powerlessness in self-perception judgments, and uniquely human traits were most negatively affected by powerlessness in meta-perception judgments. Furthermore, the powerless believed they were viewed as less human not only by the powerful people but also the outside observers of the power dynamic. Self-dehumanization also appears to be a consequence of powerlessness rather than an incidental result of a change in mood or a negative self-view. Our findings are an important extension of previous work on the adverse effects of powerlessness and dehumanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Wenqi"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Shenghua"},{"family":"He","given":"Surina"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yijie"}],"citation-key":"yang2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0125721","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0125721","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The impact of power on humanity: self-dehumanization in powerlessness","title-short":"The impact of power on humanity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0125721","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"yeung2012","abstract":"People are capable of robust evaluations of their decisions: they are often aware of their mistakes even without explicit feedback, and report levels of confidence in their decisions that correlate with objective performance. These metacognitive abilities help people to avoid making the same mistakes twice, and to avoid overcommitting time or resources to decisions that are based on unreliable evidence. In this review, we consider progress in characterizing the neural and mechanistic basis of these related aspects of metacognition—confidence judgements and error monitoring—and identify crucial points of convergence between methods and theories in the two fields. This convergence suggests that common principles govern metacognitive judgements of confidence and accuracy; in particular, a shared reliance on post-decisional processing within the systems responsible for the initial decision. However, research in both fields has focused rather narrowly on simple, discrete decisions—reflecting the correspondingly restricted focus of current models of the decision process itself—raising doubts about the degree to which discovered principles will scale up to explain metacognitive evaluation of real-world decisions and actions that are fluid, temporally extended, and embedded in the broader context of evolving behavioural goals.","author":[{"family":"Yeung","given":"N."},{"family":"Summerfield","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"yeung2012","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society B-Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2011.0416","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1594","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"English","page":"1310–1321","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Metacognition in human decision-making: confidence and error monitoring","title-short":"Metacognition in human decision-making","type":"article-journal","volume":"367"},

  {"id":"young2007","abstract":"Is the basis of criminality an act that causes harm, or an act undertaken with the belief that one will cause harm? The present study takes a cognitive neuroscience approach to investigating how information about an agent's beliefs and an action's consequences contribute to moral judgment. We build on prior developmental evidence showing that these factors contribute differentially to the young child's moral judgments coupled with neurobiological evidence suggesting a role for the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) in belief attribution. Participants read vignettes in a 2 × 2 design: protagonists produced either a negative or neutral outcome based on the belief that they were causing the negative outcome (“negative” belief) or the neutral outcome (“neutral” belief). The RTPJ showed significant activation above baseline for all four conditions but was modulated by an interaction between belief and outcome. Specifically, the RTPJ response was highest for cases of attempted harm, where protagonists were condemned for actions that they believed would cause harm to others, even though the harm did not occur. The results not only suggest a general role for belief attribution during moral judgment, but also add detail to our understanding of the interaction between these processes at both the neural and behavioral levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Liane"},{"family":"Cushman","given":"Fiery"},{"family":"Hauser","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Saxe","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"young2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0701408104","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"8235-8240","PMID":"17485679","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The neural basis of the interaction between theory of mind and moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/104/20/8235","volume":"104"},

It seems probable that individuals with higher levels of spitefulness exhibit fewer moral concerns relative to those with lower levels of spite. To examine associations between spitefulness and moral concerns, 436 community participants completed self-report measures concerning their spitefulness, basic personality dimensions, and moral concerns. Spitefulness was negatively associated with individualizing values (i.e., sensitivity to harm and fairness) such that spiteful individuals were less concerned about issues related to avoiding harm or injustice to others when making moral judgments.

This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image.
