## Experiment 1 Review

In an extension of the previous research, we sought other areas of possible interest in what could be affecting individuals likelihood to engage in either immoral or risky behaviors. So far we have shown a conenction with power motives such as Dominance, Prestige, and leadership (DoPL); along with investigating the connection between DoPL and the domain-specific risk-taking scale. An intriguing area that has not been extensively researched is narcissism. Personality research is often the viewpoint at which narcissism is investigated such as using the five-factor model concept where the primary traits are extraversion and agreeableness [@hyatt2018]. 

## Narcissism

Narcissism is a personality trait that originally was seen as a method or mechanism to shield the individual from feelings of low self-worth [@yakeley2018]. The understanding of what narcissism soon shifted with a focus on empirical understandings of the individual. Researchers such as Jeffrey Young, who expanded on the work of Aaron Beck, theorized that the core beliefs of an individual along with negative self-schemas influence the individual to seek out or act in ways in line with a narcissitic personality [@young2006]. Conceptualizations of narcissism would soon entail it to be an understanding of grandiose sense of self, fantastical beliefs of success and general superiority, along with a general lack of empathy [@americanpsychiatricassociation2013; @yakeley2018; @okada2010]./
The earliest understandings of narcissism were through Sigmund Freud. However, the term was first coined by Havelock Ellis who used the eponymous Narcissus myth in the explanation of narcissism. Freud would then publish the text *On Narcissism* to further our understanding of narcissism. Future understandings of narcissism would develop from a social congitive framework of the indvidual in relation to their environment. Such as Kernberg's assestment that narcissism stems from an aggressive and conflict filled childhood affecting the childs development and later aggression and envy towards others [@russell1985a]. 

## The present Experiments

Pathological narcissism at it's core looks strikingly similar to self-esteem and in-turn a grandiose sense of self. Investigations at risky situations have looked at sexual self-esteem, exploratory experiment one. The present experiment seeks to expand to investigate the relationship between pathological narcissism and see which is a stronger predictor of risky sexual situations and riskiness in general.
