Loading required package: StanHeaders

rstan version 2.26.4 (Stan version 2.26.1)

For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
For within-chain threading using `reduce_sum()` or `map_rect()` Stan functions,
change `threads_per_chain` option:
rstan_options(threads_per_chain = 1)

Setting 'rescor' to TRUE by default for this model
Compiling Stan program...
Start sampling
Warning messages:
1: In the future, 'rescor' will be set to FALSE by default for all models. It is thus recommended to explicitely set 'rescor' via 'set_rescor' instead of using the default. 
2: Specifying global priors for regression coefficients in multivariate models is deprecated. Please specify priors separately for each response variable.
